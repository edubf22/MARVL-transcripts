0:00
oh sure can dissect it um i think
0:03
there's all these
0:05
i want to say like cliche comments when
0:07
we talk about
0:09
um
0:10
goal setting and i'm sure like give me a
0:13
one in the chat have you heard like
0:14
boiling the ocean or how do you eat an
0:17
elephant one bite at a time right like
0:19
anyone um
0:21
when we are thinking about
0:24
our numbers for our team for ourselves
0:27
a lot of this comes down to
0:31
it can become overwhelming when the
0:33
pressure is on and we're looking at this
0:36
huge hill that we have to climb whether
0:39
it's revenue or daily activity or
0:44
just deliverables in general
0:47
how can we make it smaller micro micro
0:50
goals it's much more attainable um
0:53
anyone a fan of the book atomic habits
0:56
james clear does a phenomenal job about
0:59
explaining this if we can just take it
1:02
like one day at a time
1:04
it's hard to see
1:06
that we can achieve something when it's
1:08
too big and we can't understand it like
1:11
space is ginormous but can i think about
1:14
you know
1:15
north america
1:17
can i think about north carolina can i
1:19
think about my cul-de-sac or whatever it
1:22
is if i can bring it down
1:24
to just what's right here right now
1:26
much more attainable
1:29
mindset wise and puts us all in a much
1:32
better
1:33
spot to go achieve that goal i mean a
1:36
real quick guidance on like the easiest
1:38
way to coach for the the leaders and
1:40
managers out there don't overthink this
1:42
you start with what went well and then
1:44
you go to what didn't go well and the
1:46
thing that didn't go well you talk about
1:47
how it's going to go well next time like
1:50
that basic basic framework works for
1:53
almost any coaching conversation now
1:56
what gets lost a lot in the coaching
1:57
conversation in addition to being
2:00
positive like you said it all runs
2:02
downhill like you as a leader need to be
2:04
that umbrella that's blocking that to
2:06
your team right and and when you block
2:09
it you also create a framework around
2:11
how you're going to help that rep in
2:14
those one-on-one conversations
2:16
and so
2:17
the one of the big misses is that
2:19
conversation is only around pipeline
2:22
there's more to the role than pipeline
2:23
it's a huge part important part but
2:25
there can be more to it the second part
2:27
is nothing is documented in that
2:29
conversation and so there's no real
2:31
action item that comes off of it where
2:33
there's accountability and and
2:35
oftentimes for me that is on me hey if
2:38
leslie's on my team hey leslie i'm going
2:40
to email james
2:42
uh because we're stuck in this account
2:44
and i'm going to help you as your leader
2:46
and then the last part it needs to be
2:48
metric driven like make the
2:50
kpis all in one place where everybody
2:52
knows how you're performing it's not a
2:55
mystery so create a structure
2:58
uh or be well first be that umbrella
3:00
create that structure share the positive
3:03
with the constructive and make sure it's
3:05
documented and there's action items and
3:07
metrics that come off of it why does all
3:09
that stuff matter people want to know
3:11
where they stand uncertainty
3:14
breeds chaos right and so if somebody
3:17
doesn't know where they stand
3:19
then uh they're insecure in their role
3:22
and they're not going to perform well so
3:23
good or bad that needs to be transparent
3:26
and
3:27
as you can tell this is a pretty core
3:29
thing to us at ambition
3:31
so the question is how do we coach to
3:32
the individual's motivate motivation
3:34
because a 22 year old live at home
3:36
seller isn't the same as a 42 year old
3:38
father of three sellers right they're
3:40
motivated differently thank you uh
3:42
there's a quick answer to this you ask
3:44
them
3:45
people way overweight yeah way overthink
3:48
the the motivation or they always assume
3:51
it's money like for me it really isn't
3:54
financial i want to win now i want to be
3:57
compensated fairly and i know what that
3:59
should be and all of those things
4:01
but
4:02
i'm terrified to lose like the
4:04
motivation is i don't want to lose and
4:07
and i will spend that as in like i want
4:10
to win and when a deal signs for someone
4:12
on my team i feel immense joy right and
4:16
so you have to you have to i know for me
4:19
before i had kids my motivation was a
4:20
lot different than now that i have three
4:22
little ones like it's a very different
4:25
uh piece there so ask them that's the
4:27
answer ask them
4:29
leslie thoughts on coaching to
4:31
individuals and then the difference
4:33
between coaching to individuals and the
4:34
team as a whole
4:36
yeah um
4:37
mark hit it right on the head like for
4:39
him it's winning
4:40
i
4:41
that was one of the questions in my get
4:43
to know you anyone new who's joining the
4:45
team is like
4:47
okay talk to me about your goals
4:49
what are they what do they look like and
4:51
then i'd ask questions just tell me more
4:53
about that the same way that we like
4:56
would ask prospects questions
4:58
i think some of the most common things
5:00
that i see come up is like when um
5:03
we do a contest in a sales team it's
5:06
like the winner gets
5:08
you know a 50 gift card
5:11
here's starbucks or visa or whatever it
5:13
is um but mark like he just wants to win
5:16
so maybe he doesn't maybe the money's
5:18
not motivating him it's the
5:21
you know badge of honor it's
5:24
uh recognition so like sending an email
5:27
to
5:28
your c-suite and copying him in about
5:31
how great mark is or maybe it's
5:34
extra time off on you you get to leave
5:36
early on friday and go hang out with
5:38
your family or go to the beach or do
5:40
whatever it is that you want to do
5:42
everyone has a different feel
5:45
so like i've seen some really great
5:47
spiffs where it's like choose your own
5:48
adventure
5:50
here's the options so that you're not
5:53
sticking reps into
5:55
just
5:56
one thing that you think is going to
5:59
cover everyone because we're all sales
6:00
people
6:02
can i add here too that so ambition runs
6:05
a ton of contests like tens of thousands
6:07
of contests every year about 80 of those
6:10
don't have a prize it's visibility it's
6:13
how does james ceo see that mark the sdr
6:16
just set a meeting in an easy way put an
6:18
emoji right so don't think you always
6:20
have to have a prize
6:22
but to leslie's point individualizing
6:24
what the prize could be
6:26
we've had a number let's call it 200
6:28
bucks is what you win for the prize well
6:31
before that contest starts i'm going to
6:32
say hey go on amazon prime find me
6:34
something or multiple things that amount
6:36
to 200 bucks
6:37
and send it to me and if you win that's
6:40
what you're getting right so that is
6:42
such an easy way to individualize what
6:44
they get if it is a prize and anyone can
6:46
do that so um the first thing i want
6:49
people to hear is you don't always have
6:50
to have a prize visibility is huge and
6:53
then the second is there's easy ways to
6:55
individualize that through amazon
6:58
i think first off it's like talking
6:59
about it sharing our own and like making
7:02
sure everyone feels like
7:04
there's a piece of that i think imposter
7:06
syndrome is kind of thrown around and
7:07
there's some crazy articles out there
7:10
you can see
7:11
someone said something to me a couple
7:13
years back i wrote it down on a sticky
7:15
note i still have it in my calendar to
7:17
this day and it says there's no
7:21
b to b
7:22
or b to c anymore business is not
7:24
business to business or business to
7:26
consumer it's h human to human
7:30
and
7:31
especially when you're
7:33
starting out somewhere new when you're
7:37
fresh out of college
7:39
it is very intimidating because we're
7:41
always taught to respect you know it's
7:44
like you you hold the teacher in a high
7:46
regard you hold parents in a high regard
7:48
you and it's like this different dynamic
7:50
of power
7:51
and it's really hard to undo that
7:53
learning and just have a human
7:55
conversation with someone because you
7:57
feel like oh my gosh he's got a c in his
8:00
title
8:02
that means i have to treat him
8:04
differently or that i'm not as good as
8:06
that person and if we can start talking
8:08
about like
8:10
having those fostering those
8:11
conversations internally
8:13
letting
8:15
letting is a bad but like having our sdr
8:18
our bdr team our new hires anyone be
8:21
able to sit down and have coffee with
8:23
your ceo or just have a normal
8:25
conversation and see that they're a real
8:26
human
8:28
goes
8:29
beyond
8:30
vps whatever if you're a senior leader
8:32
especially like just go hang out and
8:34
have a talk not necessarily all about
8:36
work
8:38
with your
8:39
team
8:40
your
8:41
false evidence appearing real that
8:42
that's what uh perez just put in there
8:44
shout out to peres for that one uh
8:46
that's what fear i've heard that acronym
8:48
a couple of times now fear false
8:50
evidence appearing real
8:51
so that's good um mark the imposter
8:54
syndrome thing uh you guys probably see
8:56
this often
8:57
one everybody has it
8:59
like i have it we all have moments where
9:03
we have imposter syndrome so if you're
9:04
like an sdr calling on a c-suite person
9:08
you probably think
9:09
man do i like deserve to have this
9:12
conversation yes right and and why
9:16
because that c-suite person yeah that
9:18
they know a lot about a lot but if you
9:21
know your thing really well
9:24
then you know more than they do about
9:26
your thing right and so
9:29
um that impostor syndrome one just admit
9:32
that it's a thing and it's okay and most
9:35
people i know have it
9:37
but two if you become an expert in your
9:40
little niche
9:42
regardless of who you're talking to you
9:44
are the expert and so you can help
9:46
inform educate solve problems for that
9:49
person
9:50
and
9:51
you don't have to know every in and out
9:53
of their business you just got to know
9:54
your little corner
