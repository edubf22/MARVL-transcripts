this tip is about how to run a call
0:02
blitz
0:03
now
0:04
i personally think that sprinkling phone
0:05
calls throughout the day drastic waste
0:07
of time can't learn anything there you
0:09
can't get any momentum
0:11
and
0:12
these days it's a fool's errands
0:14
where i know phone works
0:16
is
0:17
when you're focused and i call them
0:19
power hours okay so for an hour i'm just
0:22
gonna make calls i'm not gonna do a
0:24
phone call do some research write an
0:25
email make another phone call again i
0:27
can't gain any momentum that way so for
0:29
an hour i'm just going to make cold
0:31
calls and i'm going to be hyper
0:33
efficient effective with that now
0:35
a key to that power hour
0:37
most sales reps when they do a call
0:39
blitz they just bring their list of
0:40
clients okay and it's anybody and
0:43
everybody right so it's cios cfos vps of
0:46
this and all sorts of different
0:47
industries and look
0:49
when you
0:50
have a whole bunch of different
0:51
industries a whole bunch of different
0:52
personas you're forced to be generic in
0:54
that call blitz you're forced to say
0:56
stuff like tell me about your business
0:57
you're forced to say stuff like hey what
1:00
are your priorities and give a generic
1:02
elevator pitch
1:03
because i don't know about you i am not
1:04
good enough on the fly to help have a
1:07
relevant good conversation with a vp of
1:09
sales in the sas industry a director of
1:11
i.t in the manufacturing industry and a
1:12
cfo in the healthcare industry i'm just
1:14
not that bright
1:15
so instead of taking anybody and
1:17
everybody you want to focus on a
1:19
singular persona
1:21
ideally in an industry so vp's the sales
1:24
and sas cfos in manufacturing whatever
1:26
that is because what you can do with
1:28
that is you can do a little bit of
1:29
homework to figure out you know cfos
1:31
manufacturing priorities challenges 2020
1:33
whatever right read a few articles come
1:35
up with a message right that is relevant
1:38
at least to cfos and manufacturing
1:41
then come up with two or three questions
1:42
that are relevant to them that you might
1:44
be able to ask to get the conversation
1:45
going and then maybe even have a case
1:47
study or a story to tell that's relevant
1:49
to them based on the personas that
1:51
you're calling into in that industry now
1:54
i usually do about a half hour prep or
1:56
45 minute prep for a one-hour coblets
1:58
where i get my names i get my messaging
1:59
down i'm all ready to go and then for
2:01
that hour all i'm doing is making calls
2:04
i'm not like i said doing research but
2:06
i'm just hey the reason for my call
2:08
today is we show cfos in manufacturing
2:10
how to rinse repeat rinse repeat rinse
2:12
repeat and look the first few phone
2:13
calls are gonna be a little rough they
2:15
always are but that third fourth fifth
2:17
call if you're calling into the same
2:18
persona with the same message you're
2:20
gonna get better and better and better
2:22
and every time you get someone on the
2:23
phone you're going to be able to parlay
2:25
that to the next call and get better and
2:26
better and have a lot more momentum
2:28
and you can learn something
2:31
because now with that approach you can
2:32
usually get about 20 25 dials done in an
2:35
hour and that's even with some decent
2:37
conversations then afterwards that's
2:39
when you send all your information
2:40
because you can be very efficient with
2:41
that so now you do that for an hour in
2:43
the morning
2:44
and then the afternoon you do the same
2:46
thing and you go after the same persona
2:48
but with a different message so you can
2:49
test to see which one works better
2:52
now if you do that right a lot of people
2:54
talk about 50 dials a day for instance
2:56
and how hard that is to hit and i agree
2:58
with you if you sprinkle 50 dials
3:00
throughout the day it is really hard to
3:01
hit that number
3:03
but if i do a power hour and i do 25
3:06
dials in this hour and 25 an hour an
3:08
hour i can be pretty damn efficient with
3:09
that if i do the prep work so now with
3:11
about half hour prep half hour follow up
3:14
on both of those two hours two hours
3:16
that's four hours of the day the rest of
3:18
the day i can do whatever i want with
3:19
and i've hit my numbers and i've learned
3:21
something and i've been efficient and i
3:24
got momentum so that's how to run a call
3:26
blitz make it happen
