this tip is about the power of impact
0:02
questions
0:03
when it comes to Discovery the key to
0:06
Discovery is finding impact what kind of
0:10
impact is that problem that they're
0:12
facing having on their business what
0:14
kind of impact can your solution have on
0:17
their business because if we can't find
0:19
impact what's the point we're going to
0:22
lose the nose decision all day long
0:24
so we want to find out impact and by
0:26
doing this what we can do is really
0:28
leverage that information to push back
0:31
on the client when they go dark on us
0:33
out into the dark side but when they
0:35
change their priorities because they
0:36
told us there was significant impact if
0:38
this happened or not
0:40
so the easiest way to cheat with impact
0:43
questions is put the word impact into
0:45
the question and I'll give you a perfect
0:47
one here that I recommend all of you try
0:49
which look we all ask for the timeline
0:52
okay which is hey when do you want to
0:53
have this implemented by or launched by
0:55
or whatever and then we do the reverse
0:57
close so say that's March 1st or
0:59
whatever
1:00
um okay well then it usually takes about
1:01
two weeks to go through procurement but
1:03
it takes about two weeks to get on
1:04
boarded and we go from there so if you
1:06
want it by March 1st and we have to
1:08
assign this week okay we all do that
1:10
but I really encourage you to do is ask
1:13
this question hey just out of curiosity
1:15
what's the impact to your business if we
1:18
don't launch on March 1st
1:20
and see what they say because there's
1:22
really only two answers to that question
1:24
one is real impact right all we're gonna
1:26
miss this deadline we're gonna you know
1:28
and by the way it's not just we're gonna
1:29
be stuck with our existing vendor or uh
1:32
we're gonna miss out on the promo and
1:33
the discount that's not impact I mean
1:35
business impact here right and there's
1:37
real some they'll be able to articulate
1:39
that to you and if you have that well
1:41
guess what now you can push again when
1:43
they ghost you or you can bring that up
1:44
and say hey wait a minute you said this
1:46
was the impact of your business and
1:47
that's why I'm pushing so hard and you
1:49
can really be a challenger sale
1:51
but the other answer to that question is
1:53
well we'll just kind of keep doing what
1:55
we're doing
1:56
and if you get that answer you are
1:58
either not talking to the right person
1:59
or I would not forecast that opportunity
2:01
you gotta look for impact so stop asking
2:05
these fluffy questions ask questions
2:07
looking for impact to the business all
2:10
right make it happen
