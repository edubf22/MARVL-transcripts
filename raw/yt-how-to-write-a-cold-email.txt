let's kick this off i want to talk about
0:01
hooks
0:02
hooks have a special meaning gb when you
0:05
think about the word hooks what do you
0:06
think of
0:07
all right so i mean there's like
0:10
i just think about like how do you catch
0:11
someone like how do you capture their
0:13
attention like long enough for them to
0:16
go like what is this right so if you
0:18
think about somebody scrolling through
0:20
their email or their look the first
0:22
thing they might be doing in the morning
0:23
or after a meeting is they're looking at
0:25
their phone
0:26
like they have the option to keep on
0:28
moving but there's going to be something
0:29
that hooks their attention where they
0:30
just have to stop right and check it out
0:33
that to me is what a hook is
0:35
it's a choice to stay with the message
0:39
well the i well
0:40
me being super annoying it's like it's
0:42
that mechanism that drives somebody to
0:46
making the choice to check it out so
0:47
like
0:48
i think one of the things that i've
0:49
heard about hooks it's like all right
0:51
maybe you're scrolling through your tick
0:52
tock or an instagram reel or something
0:54
and someone goes stop right you go what
0:57
you know like so just that stop like the
0:59
fact that you stopped like that to me is
1:01
the hook or if it's like hey if you are
1:04
struggling with answering this objection
1:06
and you're like hell yeah yeah you're
1:08
right like it's that thing that goes
1:10
like this is for me
1:12
i think the preview is part of that and
1:14
we're going to talk about that later but
1:15
one of the things that i know to be true
1:18
is that before you send a single email
1:20
you got to know your icp
1:22
you got to know the people that you're
1:24
going to talk to why are you talking to
1:26
them why are they the person that's best
1:28
for this conversation i'm gonna put
1:30
something in the chat right now this is
1:32
a link to zoom info you can go start
1:34
building a list of your ideal clients
1:36
and set the parameters now because
1:39
before you send a single email you got
1:40
to know why you're sending it and who
1:42
you're sending it to this is an
1:43
extremely crucial first step in all of
1:46
sales how often is this a problem in
1:48
your world gb
1:50
um it's different than not yeah yeah
1:53
yeah yeah my bad sorry i got honestly i
1:55
saw that you were wearing a chicago hat
1:56
and i'm like thank you because that's my
1:58
hometown i got distracted a little bit
2:00
there yeah we're going to be in chicago
2:01
this week i leave tomorrow if you're in
2:02
chicago hit me up we're going to throw a
2:04
party on thursday more social than sas
2:05
what let's go let's go let's go but no
2:08
yeah i i can't say like anything but a
2:10
hundred percent it's like um i think
2:12
it's uh uh sam oh it's going to bother
2:14
me that i can't remember her name off
2:15
the top of my head right now but sam
2:17
sales right yeah mckenna sam mccann
2:19
thank you thank you but it's like she's
2:20
like show me you know me right so like
2:23
if you can show someone that you've done
2:25
your research that you've taken the time
2:27
to pull something out that like only
2:29
they
2:30
like that's only gonna be relevant to
2:32
them or only they have written they're
2:33
gonna some people reward you for that
2:35
even if you don't have a solution or a
2:37
platform or service that's super helpful
2:39
for them the fact that you've taken the
2:40
time to go all right i've i've looked at
2:43
your profile i've done some research on
2:45
your company i'm seeing some of the
2:47
initiatives that your company is focused
2:49
on and how your role might be involved
2:50
in this someone might go damn
2:54
yeah
2:55
show me you know me was the first the
2:57
first time i heard that was from sam
2:58
mckenna and i think it was at the
3:00
rainmaker conference in like 2016 2017
3:04
but that really resonated well with the
3:06
crowd i remember them thinking like
3:07
that's the stuff that gets my attention
3:09
and we'll talk about this more as we
3:10
move forward but like when somebody
3:12
starts an email off with
3:14
james that webinar you did yesterday was
3:16
amazing or james that piece of content
3:19
that you put out changed my life yep
3:21
those people get my attention right away
3:24
right i will ignore other emails to open
3:27
that one
3:28
yeah 100
3:29
i think brody brody hill had asked a
3:31
question of like what's the best way to
3:33
find something the prospect or the org
3:35
has said like linkedin the website
3:37
all of it right so one of the things
3:40
that you can do is look at like
3:41
self-authored content and by the way
3:43
like a really helpful resource go check
3:45
out beck hollands flip the script uh uh
3:47
check check out her website and go under
3:49
written content and there's like an
3:51
encyclopedia of like hooks basically and
3:54
it's just telling you like here are all
3:55
the things that are all it's an
3:57
encyclopedia personalization and
3:59
relevant and so you can look at
4:00
something that if they're writing
4:01
content on linkedin like for to james's
4:03
point like for me i put a lot of content
4:05
out there on linkedin if someone goes
4:07
hey i read your post yesterday i take a
4:09
lot of pride in that so like the fact
4:11
that you're taking the time to go and
4:12
associate with something that i take
4:14
pride in i'm going to pay attention to
4:16
it other things that you can look at are
4:17
going to be a company's website of
4:19
course you can go if you're working
4:20
strategic or public accounts you can go
4:22
look at their 10ks you can read
4:25
press releases you can check out are
4:26
they launching new products right you
4:28
can see like what is the company page
4:30
actually posting are they hiring for
4:32
certain positions so like if you you can
4:34
simply go like company name
4:36
plus like strategy 2022 plus the ceo's
4:41
name and you're going to hear about all
4:42
the things that are going to be top of
4:44
mind for that company
4:45
yeah i one if i started to catch myself
4:48
getting bored with what i was saying i
4:49
was like this is too long like that's
4:51
one thing i think secondly as well is
4:53
i
4:54
if it's not conversational it's probably
4:57
not relevance
4:59
so and and then also yeah so i think
5:01
those were really the two big things was
5:03
just like all right if i'm saying this
5:04
out loud and it doesn't flow it doesn't
5:06
sound like a good conversation it
5:07
doesn't say like it doesn't sound like
5:09
me then it's not it's not going to
5:10
resonate with somebody else
5:12
um
5:13
yeah i also feel like when you read it
5:15
out loud you're asking yourself do i
5:17
talk like this
5:19
is this how i sound yeah that's the
5:23
well yeah i i feel like i run into
5:24
situations where like i let's say
5:27
previously
5:28
i wrote like how my manager wrote and
5:31
then i would say it out loud and so then
5:33
there'd just be this huge disconnect um
5:35
and i i'm a big believer in like
5:38
whatever you put out energy-wise is what
5:40
you're going to get back energy-wise so
5:42
if your energy is like i'm just trying
5:44
to sound like somebody else like you're
5:45
not going to get anybody else's
5:46
attention
5:47
so if you feel comfortable you feel
5:49
confident like you're having a good time
5:51
your prospects will too
5:54
yeah absolutely and do that if you're
5:55
not being yourself
5:57
yeah absolutely the energy has to come
5:59
across in the email even though the tone
6:01
is lost that's energy and tone are the
6:04
same but they work well together it's
6:07
important that your tone is upbeat fun
6:10
uplifting and then also it's it's always
6:12
good to have that
6:13
that personalization that adds to the
6:15
flavor of like hey i actually care right
6:18
yeah i'm putting that vibe out there
6:20
that i took the time and i did this uh i
6:22
have some emails that i can share with
6:24
you lisa uh or liz foster great question
6:27
there and i think gb was digging through
6:29
her inbox to look at some as well so
6:31
we'll get to that here in a second but
6:33
let's talk some of that about some of
6:34
this let me know if you find one you
6:35
want to share right away
6:37
uh gb i'm i'm fine with that right
6:39
i want to talk about this second to last
6:41
one because i think the second to last
6:42
one is a little bit controversial we
6:43
have about 20 minutes left so i want to
6:45
get to this one for sure remove the
6:47
informative tone
6:49
i think this is interesting because we
6:51
find lavender reports back will will
6:53
will state
6:54
that when you lose the informative tone
6:57
you actually get a higher reply rate but
7:00
all of our leadership teaches us that we
7:02
should be educating our prospects where
7:04
do we draw the line
7:08
oh good question
7:10
right so i guess i'm i'm curious about
7:12
the informative tone right like what
7:15
does that look like what does that sound
7:16
like
7:17
to me i think it sounds like did you
7:18
knows i think it sounds like hey here's
7:21
a great article that i thought would be
7:23
relevant to you uh and you know maybe
7:25
the article is great maybe you're even
7:27
pointing to that special place where
7:28
they should be looking in the article to
7:30
get that value but in the end you're
7:32
still quote educating your prospect
7:34
you're still sharing that knowledge but
7:36
then we know based on lavender's data
7:38
that if you shorten that email and lose
7:41
that informative tone that educational
7:44
tone you actually get a higher reply
7:45
rate so where do we draw the line what's
7:47
a good tactic to start thinking about
7:49
this this way it's it's definitely an
7:51
interesting conversation and feel free
7:52
to jump in in the chat and say your your
7:54
piece on this y'all yes i'm trying to
7:56
think i've seen it where like okay like
7:58
we have a gartner like let's say gartner
8:00
publishes a report and they say hey like
8:02
this percentage of
8:04
this
8:05
like
8:05
uh
8:06
uh cxo right
8:08
um so it's like 73 of cmos really care
8:11
about operational execution right like
8:13
if i start off my email like that i'm
8:15
like this is marketing this is marketing
8:17
spiel right like right it has nothing to
8:19
do with me and then also i think it's
8:20
coming across like yeah i know like i
8:22
know operational execute like i know
8:24
that operational efficiencies are
8:25
important get out of my face right but
8:28
if it's something along the lines of
8:29
like hey
8:30
see that you have uh or like you know
8:32
you you did a little bit of research and
8:34
it's like
8:35
um i always like the question even of
8:37
like hey with
8:39
if your company's has this huge like
8:40
change transfer like this digital
8:42
transformation process in place knowing
8:44
that like you know
8:46
three out of four every change
8:47
management projects fail how are you
8:49
setting your team up
8:50
to like be one of the like one of those
8:53
four who doesn't
8:55
so i'm like i'm not beating people over
8:56
the head with a bunch of information i'm
8:58
just kind of calling out like you're
9:00
doing x y and z most of the time it's
9:02
it's it's a bust like what like how are
9:04
you and your team making sure that
9:05
you're not part of that
9:07
all right so we talked about tonality
9:09
and we talked about the way that we
9:10
write uh happy tone informative tone and
9:13
a tentative tone can you break these
9:14
down for us
9:16
ooh happy tone okay so like
9:20
i feel like some people will start off
9:21
an email with all doom and gloom right
9:23
like
9:24
everything is messed up it's terrible
9:26
the world is burning the world is
9:28
burning right like i i or like or it's
9:31
just really really drab and so i think
9:33
finding ways of like or it doesn't have
9:36
to be like oh like smiley faces and
9:37
things like that yeah but
9:39
um
9:41
that's kind of like how i think about it
9:42
it's just like you don't want to go like
9:43
hey everything is messed up everything
9:44
is screwed and nothing is ever going to
9:46
be the same unless you have us it's just
9:48
more so like hey here's some things that
9:50
i'm seeing that like that i really agree
9:52
with that i think are super exciting or
9:54
that i'm super interested in like i
9:55
think there's that kind of tone to your
9:57
emails and then someone had asked this
9:59
question of like within the chat of hey
10:01
like is it if i'm if i'm referencing an
10:03
article like is that me being
10:05
informative or not if i'm
10:08
if i'm referencing like a
10:10
analyst report that anybody and
10:12
everybody can read and i'm pulling
10:13
quotes from that and i'm trying to like
10:15
go hey like look at this stuff and
10:17
here's the information that i'm going to
10:18
have if i'm just trying to like
10:20
basically just read off a gartner report
10:22
that to me is taking an informative tone
10:25
versus if i'm taking an article and i'm
10:27
saying hey like you were quoted saying x
10:29
y and z that really resonated with me
10:32
and then you ask a question about how
10:33
they're trying to do something that is
10:35
just more so like bringing in relevance
10:37
versus trying to inform someone of
10:38
something that they can go and find out
10:40
themselves for example um
10:44
yeah and so i think even for the tent
10:45
like there was something there um what
10:47
this would have been will's part of like
10:48
the tentative tone
10:50
there's the conversation about like all
10:51
right i'm trying to remember exactly
10:53
what he said like if you come in and
10:54
you're unsure about things like it's
10:56
much more like an inquisitive if that's
10:58
a better thing versus an informative but
11:00
i can't recall exactly what he said
11:02
uh there's i think it's a confidence
11:03
thing number one but then there's this
11:05
competence level too you can't display
11:07
confidence if you're not competent in
11:09
what you're doing so the two feed each
11:10
other really well uh but i know the
11:13
two-piece part was the part that caught
11:15
my attention so for those of you that
11:17
don't know will i think he's said this
11:19
on a few of our shows in the past uh he
11:20
may have even tweeted about it a time or
11:22
two uh you can go follow him on twitter
11:24
there's a lot of value there in
11:26
following him he puts out a lot of great
11:27
content about email writing specifically
11:29
uh but one of the things that he does is
11:31
he does the two piece so a valid reason
11:34
for the personalization or the relevance
11:36
or both right you can be personalized
11:38
and relevant which is like the ultimate
11:39
combo but if i have to choose between
11:42
relevance and personalization i'm going
11:43
to go relevance mostly right that tends
11:46
to have the higher reply and the second
11:48
piece of your two-piece meal is this
11:50
good flow for the message is it a linear
11:52
thought process there's no breaks that
11:55
are hard great example of a break and
11:56
this is a pattern that we see a lot hey
11:58
i see you went to the university of
11:59
maryland john anyway the reason i'm
12:01
reaching out is because i have this ai
12:02
tool right it's broken it's not
12:04
associated it's not affiliated with the
12:06
message it has no bearing on what your
12:08
value proposition is and therefore it is
12:10
meaningless you can personalize with
12:12
useless stuff like that until the cows
12:14
come home it's probably not going to
12:16
impact your open rate your reply rate or
12:18
the number of people that close business
12:21
with you and that's the ultimate goal
12:22
thoughts on that gb i see this all the
12:25
time where people go look at this really
12:27
like look at all this personalization
12:28
that i put in honestly what i think one
12:31
of the things that can plague a team is
12:34
they are more interested about in um and
12:38
their friends and their colleagues like
12:39
cheering them on in their
12:40
personalization than actually getting
12:42
results so it's like hey like i have
12:44
this really like this really witty
12:46
whatever and it's like no like have you
12:47
actually talked about what's going on in
12:49
their business have you actually talked
12:50
about what's going on in their role and
12:51
their responsibilities like in a way
12:53
that garners a response that drives
12:55
pipeline if the answer is no then i'm
12:57
like great like pat yourself on the back
12:59
and like let's do this again so
13:02
you know that's like that i mean that's
13:03
my that's my honest thought and then um
13:06
yeah i mean that's that's really it i
13:08
think we have to make sure that what for
13:09
me if i'm reading something and it goes
13:12
hey gb i saw that you like matcha lattes
13:15
and then all of a sudden we're talking
13:16
about something totally different i'm
13:17
like okay well i'm an sdr manager like
13:19
i'm gonna i appreciate the fact that i
13:21
have no idea what matcha is in your
13:23
solution and then i'm just confused yeah
13:25
right so like help me not be confused
13:27
i'm a simple i've got you know like
13:30
a reptile brain up here like make it
13:31
really simple for me to figure things
13:33
out
