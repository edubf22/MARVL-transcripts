this tip is about creating urgency
0:03
and i'm gonna tell you right now you
0:05
can't stop asking i get that question
0:08
all the time sales rep hey john how do
0:09
you create urgency we can't create
0:12
urgency as sales reps look we can
0:14
manufacture urgency all day long by
0:16
discounting and that type of thing but
0:18
that's sad
0:19
but creating it no no no what we can do
0:22
though is we can uncover it and we can
0:24
drive it
0:25
and the way that we do that is by
0:26
focusing on the priorities of the
0:29
organization of the individual we're
0:30
talking to
0:32
because look i've always been a priority
0:34
based seller okay i've always
0:35
fundamentally understood that when your
0:37
ceo stood up in the beginning of the
0:38
year and said these are the things that
0:40
we got to do to be successful this year
0:42
if i can't time my solution to one or
0:44
two of those things good luck selling
0:46
anything of significance but
0:47
unfortunately the way i used to get
0:48
there was by saying stuff like tell me
0:50
about your priorities
0:51
so now i go in
0:53
and i really try to understand the
0:55
persona in the industry and the company
0:56
that i'm looking at i do my research so
0:58
i can uncover what they're trying to get
1:00
accomplished because they don't care
1:02
about everything that we do they care
1:04
about the components of what we do that
1:05
are going to help them achieve their
1:07
goals or solve their big problems and so
1:10
we got to find out what that is and once
1:12
we find out what those priorities are
1:14
what those problems are and the impact
1:17
that those problems have
1:19
then
1:20
we have urgency we have impact and then
1:24
we can push right then we can keep
1:26
reminding them are these still your
1:27
priorities is this still your timeline
1:29
is this still the impact yes well then
1:31
we need to keep moving here and if they
1:33
ghost you you can have a document and
1:35
say are these still your priorities is
1:36
this still your timeline because if it's
1:38
not no worries just let's get back on a
1:40
call so we can reset expectations here
1:42
because that's what i was based on
1:43
everything
1:44
but if it it but if it is let's let's
1:46
move here
1:47
so you can drive urgency you can uncover
1:50
urgency but you can't create it
1:52
the way that you drive it and uncover it
1:54
is by understanding the priorities of
1:56
the business and how your solution
1:57
aligns with us and the impact that you
1:59
have to help them get there all right
2:01
don't try to create it
2:03
uncover it and drive it make it happen
