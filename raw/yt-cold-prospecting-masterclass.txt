0:00
using voicemail in a different way this
0:02
is something that i think we should all
0:04
talk about because voicemail is not the
0:06
same as it once was so how do we use
0:08
voicemail differently
0:11
yeah i mean so i think back in the day
0:14
when you're making a cold call you might
0:16
expect someone to actually you know uh
0:18
respond and actually call you back you
0:20
might say something like hey james this
0:21
is tom calling from gong you know think
0:23
you might be a good fit for what we're
0:24
selling based on abc you know here's my
0:27
number you say your number two times you
0:29
say hey call me back whenever you have a
0:30
second i don't know about you all but
0:32
i've gotten in you know seven or eight
0:34
years of sales i've probably gotten one
0:36
or two callbacks ever uh it's very rare
0:38
you might get it if you're lucky but
0:40
it's not something that you should bank
0:41
on so the way that i try to do that is
0:43
as a as a touch point to bring them to a
0:45
different channel that i'm more likely
0:47
to get a response i'm more likely to get
0:49
them to respond uh to my email or
0:52
respond to a linkedin message or some
0:54
other channel that i'm hitting them up
0:55
so i might say something like you know
0:57
hey james this is tom from gong uh
1:00
totally don't need to call me back i
1:02
actually just shot you an email uh the
1:04
subject line is you know something to do
1:06
with jb sales uh look forward to
1:08
catching up with you there or hey james
1:10
i didn't catch you here i'm actually
1:12
going to call you back at 2 p.m eastern
1:14
time hope that works for you hope to
1:15
catch it and have a conversation and so
1:17
you're using voicemail as a way to get
1:20
them to respond in a different channel
1:21
rather than just crossing your fingers
1:23
hoping they call you back
1:25
the reason why i like that is because
1:28
most emails follow or most voicemails
1:30
follow a very specific formula hi this
1:32
is me i'm calling from x we do this
1:35
thing because we're trying to sell
1:36
somebody that's not even there
1:38
and then call me back which never
1:40
happens right that's like the standard
1:42
flow but in this instance you're taking
1:44
and you're throwing that all in the
1:45
trash and you're saying
1:47
take this other action go find me at
1:49
this place go do this other thing i
1:52
really like
1:53
that assignment if you i find that
1:54
people like little assignments if you
1:56
send them you know hey do this thing it
1:58
will help you do do this right or hey do
2:00
this thing because i'm going to keep
2:02
coming at you right like that i feel
2:05
like that is that's a money strategy
2:06
right there so i really like that any
2:08
thoughts on using voicemail differently
2:09
between the two of you sam landon yeah i
2:13
i love it i use a dialer here at notes
2:15
we got we got a dialer so i use
2:16
voicemail drops
2:18
that way i can just keep going through
2:20
but make sure it's relevant to whoever
2:22
i'm calling and um
2:24
yeah similar to like tom's like when i
2:26
when i call my prospects like i'm
2:28
calling them in the morning after they
2:29
open my email but i'm also hitting them
2:31
later in the day and on that second call
2:33
that's when i'll leave the voicemail so
2:35
i want two attempts a day to get them
2:37
maybe at a different time to see if i
2:39
can increase the the the pickup rates
2:41
here's here's my scoop so for for you
2:44
any of you who have followed me before
2:45
you'll know that i don't believe in cold
2:47
calls which is why i'm being a little
2:48
mute on the idea of cold calls and
2:50
that's okay you can hate on me in the
2:51
chat go for it but here's my here's my
2:53
thought if you have to make them if you
2:54
believe in them if you love them if you
2:56
love making them whatever um here's my
2:58
thought so use use cold calls with a
3:01
different intention and the intention is
3:02
not to hustle the person to speak to
3:04
right now i am originally from
3:05
switzerland i went to swiss finishing
3:07
school i believe manners first i hate
3:09
cold calls cause i think they're rude
3:11
right just think about who just called
3:12
james it was probably a cool call
3:14
interrupting his day without his
3:15
permission to self-servingly close a
3:17
deal so here's what i say just call
3:19
inside and say james i am almost certain
3:21
i am calling you at a bad time uh you
3:23
might my name might look familiar as i
3:24
see that you've opened my emails insert
3:26
landon's play um i would love to find
3:28
somebody to talk to you about how sam
3:29
sales can help you guys if you've got
3:31
some time to chat i'd love to love to
3:33
schedule that do you have some time over
3:34
the next week or two wait grab some time
3:36
it's different right we talk about being
3:38
different all the time and it's
3:39
different people are going to be like
3:40
what instead of like james hello do you
3:42
have 36 seconds for me to tell you why i
3:43
called today no 19.3
3:47
goodbye or even sorry you guys for for
3:49
the cool calls that are like hey this is
3:51
a cool call do you want to hang up or
3:52
roll the dice i want to hang up take
3:54
care
3:55
just
3:56
bring some manners into it right it
3:58
doesn't have to be right now let them
4:00
pick a time and then hope that they show
4:02
i will also say cold calls have
4:04
historically the lowest show rates so
4:05
for all of you who are like they're
4:06
never gonna show if i schedule next time
4:08
you've gotta fish on the line talk to
4:09
them who gives a um
4:12
just schedule it for another time i
4:14
guarantee you'll be better off build a
4:15
better relationship and they might
4:16
invite other people to the call and then
4:18
you're multi-threading out of the gate
4:20
hello i want i wanna i wanna i wanna be
4:22
the opposite person i wanna tell you
4:24
that if and i'm gonna put it in writing
4:25
to be fair i love a good cold call i
4:27
will take your cold call i will talk to
4:29
you about it and then i will tell you
4:31
how bad your pitch is that is what i do
4:34
right and it's not it's not a hateful
4:36
thing it's just that you should probably
4:38
hear it right somebody has to tell you
4:40
someone has to tell you you're making
4:41
exactly this is not relevant to me and
4:44
you don't know anything about me but
4:46
thank you so much for the call
4:48
right at least if they call me back i
4:49
can assume maybe they did a little bit
4:51
more research and then called me back
4:52
and they were like yo
4:54
i just checked out who you are and let
4:56
me tell you something that's actually
4:57
relevant to you i hope that happens one
4:59
day but it hasn't happened yet um i
5:00
think brevity is is key right i think
5:02
for me i'm rarely if ever using a
5:05
subject line that's more than three
5:07
words um and you want to pass kind of
5:09
like an internal filter people have of
5:11
is this a sales person emailing me so uh
5:14
a salesy subject line might be
5:17
how to boost your win rates by you know
5:20
100 with gong
5:21
you know delete trash they're never
5:23
going to open that email um but if you
5:26
if you say if the subject line is is
5:28
kind of vague and sounds like something
5:30
maybe a co-worker might have sent or a
5:32
boss might have sent um you know like i
5:34
might say like you know your sales
5:36
strategy right i use you and your as the
5:39
first word in a lot of subject lines um
5:41
and so i think you want to mix it up i
5:43
think you want to make it sound
5:44
compelling but casual certainly not
5:47
salesy or spammy
5:48
and i've always found that the less
5:50
words the better and let's get just
5:52
straight into the email and you don't
5:54
want to give them a reason to hit delete
5:57
you know you want to at least attract
5:58
some sort of like uh of interest for
6:01
them to actually click through to it
6:03
yeah so this this has to be show me you
6:04
know me leads through every single part
6:06
of our sales cycle right whether we're
6:08
it's the very first email or we've been
6:09
working with somebody for 10 years but
6:10
show me your nobi to me is not only the
6:12
relevance and personalization of who
6:14
they are but also thinking about the
6:15
company the vertical what you know about
6:17
them so we do show me you know me
6:19
especially the higher that we go in the
6:20
chain right i saw someone say that you
6:22
know emails aren't getting through to
6:23
anybody emails are getting through to
6:25
your senior executives if you are
6:26
looking for senior executives or in
6:28
higher end smb mid-market commercial
6:30
enterprise think about email and think
6:32
about how to stand out todd capone has a
6:34
really good book called the transparency
6:36
sale and in that he shows a screenshot
6:37
of what his inbox looked like when he
6:39
was a cro 20 to 25 emails a day it is
6:42
the same thing in my inbox all day every
6:44
day and it is the same generic subject
6:46
line so think about again that idea of
6:48
being different how can we be different
6:51
so do some show me you know me if you
6:52
reach out to me we've got 900 people on
6:55
the call today if you reach out to me
6:58
and you send something that says like
6:59
nickelodeon plus you know orlando plus
7:02
linkedin plus barefoot contessa plus
7:04
anything that you can find on my
7:06
linkedin profile i will respond to your
7:08
email
7:09
i'm wondering how many of you guys will
7:11
reach out with that show may know me but
7:12
it's different it shows you've done your
7:14
homework we're asking people for 15 20
7:16
minutes and then somehow still always
7:17
then a 30-minute calendar invite i do
7:19
not know why but we're asking them for
7:20
that just show that you've done five or
7:23
ten minutes of your homework yes it
7:24
takes time quality over quantity here i
7:27
promise you if you do that
7:29
personalization someone will at least
7:31
open your email which is the toughest
7:33
thing to do in the first place and then
7:36
tie some value together with that right
7:37
james said i used in south florida i
7:39
grew up in florida now i can tie that
7:41
together i can talk about that i know
7:42
the gym goes to the the gym because i
7:44
can see them on instagram doing that i
7:45
can tie that together and i can say but
7:47
you talk about them forever the real
7:48
reason for my outreach is this you as
7:50
this specific title have this specific
7:52
challenge i assume because the people
7:53
that we work with in your same time
7:54
don't have that challenge here's a
7:56
specific way that we can solve that for
7:57
you and that's the relevancy right
7:59
relevancy isn't about the
8:01
personalization so to speak it's about
8:02
the personalization to that buyer
8:04
persona i know what your challenges are
8:06
i suspect that you have the same
8:07
challenges that these buyer personas
8:09
have that we work with here's a specific
8:11
way we can solve that how does that
8:12
sound there's much more to it than that
8:14
but that's a start
8:15
all right you guys so um breakdown of a
8:18
cold email and this is something that we
8:19
use day in and day out you might be
8:20
looking at something like oh my god it's
8:22
so long here's the thing to think about
8:23
so you're covering a couple things one
8:25
shout out to gong great partner of us
8:27
love them if you don't have it in your
8:29
toms territory give them a shout um
8:31
here's the thing now gong talks about
8:32
how longer emails work versus shorter
8:35
emails the long email again has to be
8:37
personal relevant and intentional so
8:39
check that out this breakdown this is
8:41
what we teach all day every day number
8:43
one subject line show me you know me it
8:45
thinks about so a former fa this is a
8:47
flight attendant somebody on our team
8:48
was a flight attendant reached out to a
8:50
former flight attendant what a great way
8:51
to connect now the other thing think
8:53
about taking away the salesy subject
8:55
line or the salesy first sentence we do
8:57
not want to have something in here that
8:58
says i hope this means you will happy
9:00
monday there are no happy mondays right
9:01
cut that out right now happy friday is
9:03
the only thing that exists take out
9:05
anything that says sales and subject
9:06
lines sales in the first sentence right
9:08
all of that stuff looks the same be
9:10
different we keep talking about that now
9:12
next we want to make sure that we tie
9:14
the show me you know me right so talk
9:16
about the flight attendant piece you
9:17
know relate a story back to that connect
9:19
with that person as a shocking human
9:21
right awesome opportunity just make that
9:24
connection and then to say again the
9:25
reason for my initial outreach is xyz
9:27
what you want to think about next the
9:29
biggest mistake that i see every single
9:31
company make when we rewrite their
9:32
sequences and we dive in is that they
9:34
focus on the 30 000 foot level of what
9:36
they do instead of one specific thing
9:38
and we think about what's your 300
9:40
household what's your 300. so instead of
9:42
saying hey welcome to sam sales welcome
9:44
to jb vera's what we talk about is sales
9:46
training all day long that's great we
9:48
have sales trainers we don't need that
9:49
so instead how about we say hey
9:52
i suspect that you guys invest in sales
9:53
navigator you probably don't get the
9:55
adoption and the usage out of it one
9:56
specific thing that we can sell for you
9:58
is xyz
9:59
then again we've thought about that
10:00
person the specific buyer persona the
10:02
challenge that they have and we are
10:04
thinking about the key the key the key
10:05
the money maker for you here is the idea
10:07
of the hidden or forthcoming objection
10:10
if i say that to a vp of sales and say i
10:12
you guys have navigator we can help you
10:14
what they're going to say is we don't
10:15
need you we have a csm from linkedin to
10:17
which i can respond you might already
10:20
have a csm from linkedin but here's how
10:22
we can train you better and here's also
10:24
why we train linkedin on how to use
10:26
linkedin mic drop so we've got to think
10:29
about the hidden or forthcoming
10:30
objection in order to get around it in
10:32
the email because i promise you they're
10:33
not going to a respond and they're not
10:34
going to respond with that objection
10:36
get around it if you already know what
10:38
it is if you know what the typical thing
10:40
is that comes back do that final thing i
10:42
never ever ever ever i love calendly
10:44
they're great i never ever ever put a
10:46
calendar link to my calendar in outbound
10:49
email how presumptuous i say this all
10:51
the time tom has definitely heard me say
10:52
this but to me it is the equivalent of
10:54
walking up to somebody at a bar being
10:56
like you're adorable i'd love to get
10:57
drinks sometime that person says that's
10:59
great and you say here's my calendar for
11:01
you to schedule that date with me no
11:04
we would never do that and yet somehow
11:05
we think it's appropriate outbound sales
11:08
be human be different say let me know
11:10
what works for you i'd love to schedule
11:11
time with you and let me know your times
11:13
and i'll send a calendar invite along
11:14
recording like do the work give a shit
