0:00
so uh we've got some suggestions for you
0:02
uh we are uh excited to bring these to
0:05
you this is how we would handle these
0:06
objections i'm not even gonna i'm not
0:07
even gonna fluff this up let's go let's
0:09
go all right here we go is this a sales
0:11
call john
0:12
ah so this one's a good one because
0:14
again the nuances of this one matter if
0:16
you ask is this a sales call versus is
0:18
this a cold call so this is why it's
0:20
important to write down all your
0:21
objections word for word now if this is
0:24
a sales call here's my john barrow's
0:26
masshole approach to this one is not
0:29
like i don't know how the exact words i
0:32
say are
0:34
uh it depends
0:35
and they'll i usually say excuse me and
0:38
i'll say well it depends what currently
0:40
you guys fit a very similar profile to
0:42
some other clients that we've do some
0:43
done some great work with and all i'm
0:45
looking for right now is about five to
0:47
ten minutes of somebody's time so i can
0:48
have that conversation and if there's a
0:50
need then yes it turns into a sales call
0:52
but as of right now i don't know
0:55
so it's kind of a little bit of a
0:56
jackass like way of doing it but
0:59
it it it keeps the conversation going
1:01
because they're almost always like when
1:02
you say i don't know it depends they're
1:05
they're always gonna say what what do
1:07
you mean by that and it's almost gonna
1:09
be contentious but then if you show them
1:11
you've done your research on the account
1:12
before you've made that phone call and
1:14
there's an actual reason for your call
1:16
sometimes they're more open to having
1:18
that discovered
1:20
i like that you know i kind of say that
1:21
depends too but instead of
1:24
the mass way that you describe what
1:27
i love that term which what i say is do
1:29
you hang up on sales people
1:31
and then i just leave it there
1:33
now if you're calling especially if
1:34
you're like calling people that lead
1:36
sales teams which is often the case
1:37
right we're calling leaders yeah if you
1:39
say do you hang up on sales people and
1:41
they manage sales people i think there's
1:42
like this little tinge of guilt that
1:44
they care
1:45
and a little laugh there kind of helps
1:48
well and i think well that's an
1:49
important point like if you can it's all
1:51
a lot of it is about pattern interrupt
1:53
and doing something that's a little
1:54
different and also being a normal human
1:56
being too i mean you don't have to be a
1:57
jerk like when i say it depends i'm
1:59
being genuine it does it's not that i'm
2:02
saying oh i'm trying to use a trick here
2:04
it really does depend i'm not trying to
2:06
sell you anything
2:08
that you don't need but if there's a
2:10
need yeah then i'm going to sell you
2:12
something because it's going to make a
2:12
difference here and if you have that
2:14
mentality i think you can get away with
2:15
that approach
2:16
i like it i like it john why don't you
2:18
call me back in six months
2:21
so great perfect so just out of
2:23
curiosity what's going to change in six
2:24
months right and and you could do that
2:27
or what i also like to do is ask this
2:30
hey what are the other initiatives that
2:31
you're working on right now that are
2:33
taking priority over something like this
2:35
and how is that going to change and when
2:36
when do you think those are going to get
2:37
off your plate so we can have a real
2:39
conversation about this because what i'm
2:41
trying to do there is get some context
2:44
from you so that when i do call you back
2:47
i have something to reference so if
2:49
you're like look right now i'm just too
2:50
buried i'm working on xyz projects
2:52
because they got weight they're taking
2:53
up way too much of my time well
2:54
fantastic great you know what i'll call
2:56
you back in six months and we can have a
2:58
much better conversation at that point
3:00
now when i call you back in six months
3:01
i'm gonna a do my research on you to
3:03
make sure that i have a reason to reach
3:04
out to you and b i'm gonna reference
3:06
what you told me six months ago to let
3:08
you know that we've actually had a
3:09
meaningful conversation i'll probably
3:11
call you three months later by the way
3:13
i like that one uh leslie has a good one
3:15
that's quick and easy she says i'm just
3:17
curious why
3:19
yep and i think that's a great response
3:21
it's fast it's easy my fast easy
3:23
response is is that when you focus on
3:25
new initiatives
3:27
and sometimes you get people that are
3:28
really they give you the brush off right
3:30
they're like yeah totally new
3:31
initiatives whatever man yeah and you're
3:32
like all right cool like you were never
3:33
interested in this conversation to begin
3:35
with right but then sometimes they're
3:37
like well it's not that it's just that
3:39
and then they fill in the gap of what
3:41
they're focused on and i can attach my
3:43
value to the things that matter so you
3:45
sort of set them up for that that very
3:46
human response uh that's the job john is
3:49
this a good
3:50
real quick the key to all this is
3:52
getting them to continue to talk because
3:54
the more they talk the more they're
3:56
gonna they're gonna hit you with an
3:57
objection right up front that's a real
3:59
basic lame you know surface level
4:01
objection and if you can just get them
4:03
talking more nine times out of ten you
4:05
they get you can kind of at least
4:06
unravel a little bit what they're really
4:08
what their situation is and then real
4:10
have a real conversation sorry what's
4:12
the next one no no you're fine you're
4:13
fine uh and you're right like the whole
4:15
most of what we're saying here is about
4:16
keeping the conversation going if you
4:18
can manage to keep the conversation
4:20
going it'll last as long as it needs to
4:22
last you know if it's 10 minutes great
4:24
if it's half an hour and they end the
4:25
call with man this was a really
4:26
refreshing call you did a great job
4:29
now is not the right time john can you
4:31
this is not a good time for me
4:34
uh so totally get that most people i
4:36
talk to this is kind of the feel for fun
4:38
totally get that most people i talk to
4:39
don't have time immediately um when
4:42
would be a good time and and what is on
4:44
your plate right now that's getting in
4:45
your way of having this conversation so
4:46
again trying to understand what's going
4:48
on in their world right now and lock
4:50
them into a certain time and then if
4:52
they say tomorrow at three o'clock or
4:54
i'm sorry if they say next week what you
4:56
want to do is win next week and be very
4:58
specific actually you got your calendar
5:00
in front of you look why don't we just
5:01
throw something on the calendar now this
5:02
way we don't have to play chase and by
5:04
the way those words are important this
5:06
way we don't have to play chase letting
5:08
them know you're going to chase them and
5:10
we can do this the easy way or the hard
5:11
way it's your choice yeah we can do this
5:14
dance for like 10 weeks where like i
5:16
hate you all the time and you ignore me
5:18
and then i keep hitting you and then you
5:19
call me and going we can do that it's
5:21
totally fine or we could set it up and
5:24
really have like a good conversation
5:25
right
5:26
i say
5:28
we should throw something on your
5:29
calendar when they say this isn't a good
5:31
time we should throw something on your
5:32
calendar and you can even follow it with
5:34
what works next week
5:36
are you in front of your calendar is a
5:37
really magic question because anybody
5:39
that tells you no is a liar
5:43
and also there's a small nuance to this
5:45
as well that that objection specifically
5:47
this also comes with a preemptive strike
5:49
so when you are cold calling if you are
5:51
getting the this isn't a good time all
5:53
the time
5:54
then start your call with that hey james
5:57
i know i probably didn't catch you at a
5:59
great time do you got 30 seconds to tell
6:00
you what so i can tell you why i'm
6:01
calling before you hang up on me right
6:03
so you preemptively address you know
6:05
it's not a good time it's never a good
6:07
time when somebody calls that's why i
6:08
hate the intro is this a good time the
6:11
reason is is
6:12
the reason it's always no is because i
6:14
don't know who you are and therefore i
6:16
have no idea how long this is going to
6:18
take right so if you start your intro a
6:20
lot of these objections that you get can
6:22
be preempted by how you introduce
6:24
yourself on the phone like a lot of
6:26
times i'll just say hey james thanks for
6:29
taking my call can i get 30 seconds to
6:30
tell you why i'm calling before you hang
6:32
up on me and and that's a preemptive
6:34
strike and all i'm trying to do there is
6:35
sell 30 seconds because if i can sell
6:38
that 30 seconds and you get to agree to
6:39
those 30 seconds then in that 30 seconds
6:41
my value proposition should hopefully
6:43
buy me another two minutes maybe to ask
6:45
a question to keep this conversation and
6:47
in those two minutes that's gonna buy me
6:49
that discovery call yeah you're gonna
6:51
notice john's pattern there where he's
6:52
buying more time with each response and
6:56
there's that pattern of like make a
6:57
statement and then ask a question uh so
6:59
here's a good one i think people get
7:01
this one a lot especially at the
7:02
enterprise level you know what john this
7:04
sounds great but we do all this stuff
7:05
in-house
7:07
perfect there's most of the clients that
7:08
we work with as a matter of fact do a
7:10
lot of the stuff internally either you
7:12
know on a scale of one to ten of
7:14
everything that you're working on as it
7:15
relates to this are you a 10 out of 10
7:17
at every level
7:19
right and what i'm trying to do there is
7:21
get base if you say you're a 10 out of
7:22
10 at every level with what i'm bringing
7:24
to the table for you that's a hundred
7:25
percent of a blow-off and and by the way
7:27
i'm actually that's a that's not
7:29
necessarily a bad thing because i'm
7:30
going to use that later because i'm
7:31
going to call you back and i'm going to
7:33
say to you you're like yep i'm a 10 out
7:34
of 10 with everything all right james
7:36
look nope they're great man look most of
7:38
our clients aren't a 10 out of 10 with
7:40
everything i mean it might be 9.5 but
7:42
not 10 good for you hey would you mind
7:43
if i called you back in like three to
7:45
six months to see if you were still out
7:46
of 10 out of 10 with that right because
7:49
and you're usually gonna say yeah sure
7:50
fine and then i'm gonna call you in
7:52
three months i'm gonna say hey james we
7:53
talked about three months ago you said
7:55
you were a 10 out of 10 with how you
7:57
were dealing with everything internally
7:58
as it relates to this if it's even
8:00
dipped to a nine man there's a reason
8:01
for us to chat
8:03
i really like that because you're sort
8:05
of setting it up so that you can f like
8:07
it's like a touch that you want to know
8:08
if this person just wants you to go away
8:11
exactly and when they give me a 10 out
8:12
of 10 they just want you to go away
8:15
and but the beauty of that is you're
8:16
going to bring it back to them and
8:18
you're going to use it against them
8:19
later because because when i call you
8:21
three months you're not going to
8:22
remember that we had this conversation
8:23
three months ago but i'm going to say
8:25
that you said you were a 10. and so
8:28
nobody's ever attend so if i catch you
8:30
in that moment of man i wish i had more
8:32
resources
8:34
now it's like man maybe i'm not and i'm
8:36
going in the wrong direction by the way
8:37
i was a 10 and now i'm nine now on the
8:39
other hand if you say that and they're
8:41
like well you know we're probably like a
8:42
nine or an eight it's okay great well
8:44
just you know for a few more minutes
8:45
here what would make it a 10
8:47
well if we had the ability to do x y and
8:49
z well look that's exactly what we do is
8:53
that worth 15 minutes so i can show you
8:55
how we're working with other internal
8:56
teams here and augmenting them so they
8:58
can get that time back to focus on those
9:00
other things that are more important to
9:01
them
9:02
man your your responses are like so
9:05
fast and i feel like they they
9:08
hit the high note and then they're gone
9:10
uh you know it's really fast and then
9:13
there's this engagement part of it that
9:14
comes afterwards where they have to
9:16
respond to you with thought you can't
9:18
just be like yeah yeah and then like
9:19
brush it off that's like a key factor in
9:21
all these objection handles that we're
9:23
giving you is people have to put thought
9:25
behind the answers the one that i throw
9:27
out there in this moment is is there
9:29
anything that you feel has been
9:30
overlooked this is their moment to tell
9:32
me whether or not they're a 10 out of 10
9:34
right and if they're if they are which
9:36
you know a lot of times you get the
9:37
brush off what i do is i go well listen
9:39
this is what we do i have a lot of
9:41
resources i want to share those with you
9:43
over time i'm going to send you some
9:44
emails i'm going to be getting in touch
9:46
with you soon but i appreciate your time
9:47
today thanks for the quick call and i
9:49
let them go
9:50
but then i drop them into this great
9:53
cadence that delivers consistent value
9:55
that's relevant to them and i get a lot
9:57
of thank yous i get a lot of this is the
9:59
best thing that's hit my inbox that just
10:01
happened to me yesterday this is the
10:02
best thing that hit my inbox if you can
10:04
get someone saying that you have
10:05
really won the game
10:07
absolutely
10:08
or you will win it eventually eventually
10:10
yeah i play the long game john you know
10:12
i play the long game it's hard to ignore
10:15
me dude
10:16
that's the key the key is the long game
10:18
if you are trying to convince somebody
10:19
in the short term and stuff it down
10:21
their throat you get you're gonna have
10:23
to do a volume game you're gonna have to
10:24
make hundreds of dials and just burn
10:26
through your list but if you play the
10:27
long game you can be patient you can
10:30
find the right opportunities you don't
10:31
have to push and people will respect it
10:33
we got a few more minutes i think we
10:34
have a few more minutes i want to get as
10:35
many of these in as we can i really like
10:37
this one because i think people get this
10:38
one most often especially when they're
10:40
playing that volume game i don't take
10:42
random cold calls
10:46
don't take foreign interesting one well
10:49
this isn't random uh and so here's i'm
10:51
thinking about this one on the fly here
10:52
because uh
10:54
i haven't had that one in a while but
10:55
it's uh you know well this isn't random
10:58
and they're gonna say again well what
10:59
are you talking about this isn't random
11:01
no no no you like look i get it if you
11:03
you probably get a bunch of phone calls
11:05
from people who are just ripping through
11:06
lists and giving you generic elevator
11:07
pitches i'm telling you right now
11:09
there's a reason i'm calling you and
11:11
this is why it's so important to have a
11:14
reason for your call all right for
11:17
everybody out there listening right now
11:18
when you start your phone call you have
11:20
to finish this sentence the reason for
11:21
my call is and you've got to be able to
11:23
finish that sentence if not you should
11:25
not be making the phone call and ideally
11:27
it's something based on research you've
11:28
done so therefore it's not random so
11:31
here's an here's a scenario james
11:33
you say to me uh john i don't take
11:35
random phone calls james i'm going to
11:37
tell you right now this is not random
11:39
and i'm going to dead stop on that and
11:41
it's gonna force you to go well what do
11:43
you mean james look i know you probably
11:45
get a bunch of phone calls from sales
11:47
reps who are just giving you some
11:48
generic pitch and you're on a list and
11:50
half of it yeah 99 of it's irrelevant
11:53
the reason i'm calling you is because i
11:54
was actually on your website and i
11:55
noticed that you're hiring a whole bunch
11:57
of sdrs right now and and we work with
11:59
companies who are hiring sdrs because
12:01
our training plugs right in and helps
12:02
them get ramped right out of boot camp
12:04
and that's why i'm calling you this is
12:05
not random my friend do you have five
12:07
minutes for a conversation about how we
12:09
do this so i first of all i want to make
12:11
two comments when you started that i
12:13
felt like wow that was aggressive well
12:15
let me tell you this is not random but
12:17
then you ended with can i tell you why
12:19
this isn't random my friend
12:20
and there was this like shift in in the
12:22
mind right where it's you feel like oh
12:25
and you're taken aback but then you hear
12:27
the my friend
12:29
and then there's this change in your
12:30
demeanor and i love that i feel like
12:32
that's a superhuman one uh
12:35
when you think about it that's all we're
12:36
trying to do is get people to open up
12:38
y'all we're just trying to get them to
12:39
open up they have to drop the rapport my
12:41
my the one that i go to when people say
12:43
i don't take calls is well
12:45
do you guys have callers
12:48
and i leave it right there do you guys
12:49
have callers i i have the the luxury of
12:52
calling sales leaders most of the time
12:54
so for me
12:55
for me when i say do you have callers
12:57
the answer is almost always yes i say
12:59
well i'm sure you want people to take
13:01
their cold calls right
13:02
but it's fine if you don't like cold
13:04
calls we can set something up are you in
13:06
front of your calendar and i pivot there
13:08
most of the time people will decide to
13:10
pivot and at least give me some level of
13:12
respect which is all i'm asking for in
13:14
that moment right
13:15
you have callers respect me as a caller
13:17
that's all i'm asking
13:18
uh john this is one of my favorites and
13:20
i think this one goes a long way for a
13:21
lot of people john we're all set we're
13:23
good
13:25
okay so are you i'm gonna go back to my
13:26
10 out of 10. so are you a 10 out of 10
13:28
with your existing solution in place and
13:30
again i'm going to back down to if it's
13:32
a 9 what would make it a 10 and would
13:34
that be worth 10 minutes to show you how
13:36
if it's a 10 great can i call you back
13:38
in three months to see if it's still out
13:40
of 10 out of 10 and then i'm gonna call
13:41
you in three months and say you said
13:43
three months ago that you were a 10 out
13:44
of 10 with this if it's dipped to a nine
13:46
we should have a conversation
13:48
again quick fast there you notice
13:50
there's no like stuttering and there's
13:52
no stammering in his response and i
13:54
think that's because
13:56
when you start thinking about these
13:57
types of objections in advance and you
13:59
start working on them yourself it
14:01
becomes second nature to respond in the
14:04
general way that you would respond it
14:05
might not be the same exact language all
14:07
the time
14:08
my go-to for this one is when i hear
14:11
we're all set sometimes i think it means
14:13
people would rather not talk to me is
14:14
that what's happening here and i just
14:16
give them the chance to say yeah i can't
14:17
have this conversation right now and i
14:19
go that's cool i'll call you tomorrow
14:20
and then and then i hang up
14:23
look i we're coming up on time but i
14:25
wanted to make one point on your
14:26
previous point here which is
14:28
objection handling is about being
14:30
proactive versus reactive and you have
14:31
to use these techniques early on in your
14:33
career so that you know how to use them
14:35
later on in your career without thinking
14:37
about them as a technique the reason
14:39
that most of these can fly off of my
14:40
tongue is because i've made 400 dials a
14:42
week for the majority of my
14:45
career and i practiced these techniques
14:47
over and over and over again until they
14:50
became innate until they became natural
14:52
for me which is why i can kind of pop
14:54
and do it whenever
14:56
you gotta focus you gotta pick one
14:58
objection find figure out a technique
15:00
try it out a bunch of times and see how
15:02
it flows with you and you'll figure it
15:03
out along the way practice makes perfect
15:05
y'all i hope you enjoyed this we'll see
15:07
you soon come to the events that are
15:09
upcoming we promise that we will
15:10
continue to drive value that helps you
15:12
sell better we'll see you soon everybody
15:14
