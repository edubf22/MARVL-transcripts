0:00
it's like the friend zone but way worse
0:03
that's all there is to it so the really
0:06
the for me like the way that i look at
0:09
the identity around someone ghosting is
0:11
that typically what's happening is just
0:13
something that's out of our control in
0:15
most cases whether it's personal
0:17
or there is a business initiative that
0:19
was going on behind the scenes that we
0:20
didn't know about right so
0:22
to me like putting a label on it to
0:24
understand more that there's uh there's
0:25
usually emotional context involved and
0:28
there are things that we can't
0:29
necessarily understand or explain
0:31
and also it
0:33
the thought about around that is to
0:36
curate your approach differently so more
0:38
empathy less hey did you get my last 17
0:41
emails you know like
0:42
that could just feel obnoxious to people
0:44
especially when it's not necessarily
0:46
their prerogative to ignore you to begin
0:49
with listen like anybody out there
0:51
that's listening i've been in sales for
0:53
15 plus years now
0:55
and i'm still a young guy okay i don't
0:57
have a lot of gray in my beard yeah
0:58
james buckley's gonna say something in
1:00
the comments here in a second about how
1:01
old i am because we've been hanging out
1:03
recently and he's like man your knees
1:04
are pretty bad bro can you even play
1:06
basketball anymore you suck old man
1:09
right so i digress the the idea though
1:11
is that i started at a young age as a
1:13
millennial and in a space where now like
1:17
pretty much every single decision maker
1:18
was like 30 years older than me when i
1:20
first got in that's how it looked and
1:22
and to myself i kept saying i must not
1:25
be relevant i must not be able to get
1:26
their attention correctly i had all
1:28
these things going on through my head
1:29
and really like an awakening for me and
1:31
understanding like what that ghosting
1:33
zone truly is is when i had somebody
1:35
finally get back to me and be like yo
1:36
just chill bro i'm gonna get back to you
1:39
like just chill and and i do it too to
1:43
people all the time and don't even mean
1:44
to in most cases so i think the one
1:46
thing that we want to understand about
1:47
the ghosting zone is that we're all
1:49
capable of becoming a victim to it and
1:52
that really it's about constant and
1:54
ongoing communication that goes beyond
1:56
your sale
1:57
and creates and provides emotional
1:58
context between the two of you as well
2:00
so that that person feels okay enough to
2:02
say something like hey my daughter just
2:04
had her baby and i'm gonna be
2:07
completely
2:08
away from my email for the next two days
2:10
sorry that i was supposed to sign your
2:12
deal tomorrow it's not going to happen
2:14
right that that proactive mindset is how
2:16
the ghosting zone for me really becomes
2:18
something that we live in constantly to
2:20
to
2:21
in a state of consistency i should say
2:23
to keep ourselves from having to suffer
2:25
inside of it
2:27
so you just have to think a little bit
2:29
bigger than what the typical playbook
2:32
would tell you right and please for the
2:34
love of god stop sending bump emails and
2:36
you know like just checking in and like
2:38
are you okay to the top of your inbox
2:40
check this out real quick yeah miranda
2:42
that's it right there check this out
2:43
real quick i just sent this email this
2:45
one works really well uh i just sent it
2:47
recently to three people i got three
2:49
responses the subject line is did you
2:52
die with a question mark now first off
2:54
be very careful about sending
2:56
that email you have to have a really
2:58
good relationship with people but think
3:00
about that for a second that i can send
3:02
that email to specific people and i know
3:04
they won't be offended i know they'll
3:06
laugh and i know they'll get back to me
3:08
right that is a deep connection right
3:10
there that's not just a hey let me send
3:13
this email and see if it works to this
3:14
random person that i'm trying to get
3:16
back in touch with right that is the
3:18
concept of proactively selling
3:20
connecting and giving people the right
3:21
kind of experience
3:23
now miranda have you ever used a
3:26
creative kind of outlet in your outreach
3:27
to really hook someone in and if so what
3:30
did you do
3:31
that's a great question i definitely
3:33
don't think i can compare to dale on any
3:34
of these but what i will say
3:36
is um something that i did that i think
3:39
has served me really well in my approach
3:41
is just humanizing myself in the process
3:43
and just being a person so the best
3:45
example i can give you is back in
3:47
december i was on a bit of a hot streak
3:50
in terms of i was still in sdr at that
3:51
point in time and i was going for our
3:53
record of the most meeting set in a day
3:56
and i was at nine and i really really
3:57
wanted to hit that ten and put myself
3:59
above just just for my own sake to
4:01
really feel proud of my performance for
4:02
the day and i was finally able to get
4:04
somebody back who had ghosted a
4:06
different um sdr of ours in the past and
4:08
really was like hey man i will i will
4:11
buy you and your significant other and
4:12
he was prepping for his anniversary
4:14
dinner with his wife and i was like let
4:15
me treat you and your wife to lunch
4:17
drinks whatever it is on me if you will
4:19
help me beat this record like this would
4:21
absolutely make or break my like sdr
4:23
career so far and ended up getting him
4:25
back and it ended up going pretty well
4:27
in my book so um definitely always pull
4:29
the anniversary card and um when in
4:32
doubt just
4:33
compliment their wife or their spouse
4:34
their partner and i found that worked
4:35
well too
4:36
i just want to reiterate like an
4:38
underscore
4:40
that these are people who you have had
4:42
some sort of connection with we're not
4:43
talking cold calling has never responded
4:45
to you so everything that dale and
4:47
miranda has said it's something that
4:48
they've actually had this relationship
4:50
they've created they've had conversation
4:52
so like just want to underscore it again
4:54
i think it's worth highlighting
4:56
my um
4:58
a couple things so the doordash story
4:59
adrian
5:00
i had someone who we had meetings booked
5:03
and then it was canceled meeting book
5:05
and then it was canceled and i was like
5:07
hey i just want to make sure
5:08
everything's okay and the woman replied
5:12
that she had a sick child at home and i
5:14
said
5:15
you know
5:16
we'll reschedule later don't even worry
5:18
about it i know what it's like from one
5:21
mother to another here's doordash so
5:22
that you can eat a real lunch today
5:25
and it was without the expectation of a
5:28
sale or booking and i think that that's
5:30
something that
5:32
is important too that we're being humans
5:34
right that we're showing up and it's
5:35
just hey i want to help you out i
5:37
understand what you're going through
5:39
been there right let me be a human and
5:41
just show that i care um and i know that
5:44
some people have boundaries in term or
5:46
like limits in terms of monetary gifts
5:48
if that's something that you can't do
5:50
the other thing that i think is
5:53
different that's showing up different is
5:55
send a video
5:57
when we are sending emails
5:59
a lot of times it's getting lost right
6:01
it's words it's text on a screen and
6:03
like some of the things show up and you
6:05
know i know miranda has done some
6:07
awesome memes memes the the giffies
6:11
right and like
6:12
but if we're showing up different if
6:14
they have a connection with us
6:16
and we can show that our concern is
6:18
genuine and that we care they can hear
6:20
the inflection in our voice we can joke
6:23
a little bit different because sometimes
6:25
people read things incorrectly but if
6:28
we're saying it
6:30
our tone is there and we have this
6:32
connection um i could just be like hey
6:36
hey we haven't been able to catch each
6:38
other thought i'd make you a quick video
6:40
um curious if anything's changed it's
6:43
completely fine if it has just let me
6:45
know
6:46
and
6:47
letting my tone and my energy show
6:49
through um
6:50
i've seen quite a few people
6:52
mention different industries than
6:54
they're in and what's working and what's
6:55
not and there is
6:57
a good piece of that like if you could
6:59
just show up
7:00
in a different way than what you have
7:02
been doing
7:04
you know any of these ideas showing up
7:06
different do something out of the box
7:09
pop em a linkedin voice note or oh yeah
7:12
hardcore with the linkedin voice note or
7:15
even a video on linkedin if you're first
7:17
degree connected like just something
7:18
different
7:19
something different can i riff on this
7:21
for a second is that of course like
7:22
feeling inspired as hell by leslie and
7:25
so there's a couple things that are very
7:27
important i think to what she's saying
7:28
that everybody can take a piece of which
7:30
is that she's talking about the basics
7:32
around like human principles and the
7:35
psychology of the way that a
7:36
regular human being operates so like
7:39
think back to being like 12 years old
7:41
and having a surprise birthday party
7:43
thrown for you and up to 12 years old
7:44
you've never had a surprise birthday
7:46
thrown for you so every year you're
7:48
expecting this kind of same thing for
7:50
your birthday and then your mom and dad
7:51
go all out and they hook it up and
7:53
you're at chuck e cheese and all your
7:54
friends are there and you're eating
7:56
pizza that a rat gave you and it's
7:58
incredible and and that that moment that
8:00
changes your life though right it
8:02
literally changes your freaking life and
8:04
this is the thing is that we we take for
8:06
granted the opportunities that we have
8:08
to impact people so often we think oh i
8:11
gotta hit quota oh i need to sell
8:13
something oh i want to buy that fancy
8:15
car and so i got to make this 17 000
8:17
commission shout out to all the copier
8:18
warriors out there that hit those big
8:20
bucks right so but the thought again is
8:22
is that how can i detach myself from
8:24
this leslie said something very
8:25
important that everybody needs to think
8:26
about expectations
8:28
what expectations do you have when
8:30
interacting with another human being are
8:31
you sitting back and saying oh i need
8:33
something from this person i have to
8:35
have this thing this deal could change
8:37
my life well guess what
8:38
that doesn't matter what matters is is
8:40
the fact that that you have the
8:42
opportunity to influence the way that
8:44
other people think about sales the way
8:46
that other people think about human
8:47
interaction at my father's funeral a guy
8:49
came up to me and there was thousands of
8:51
people that came up to me i mean
8:52
literally i'm not exaggerating nice for
8:54
eight hours after my dad's funeral we
8:55
had people coming up to us telling us
8:57
stories people we'd never met in our
8:58
lives there was a guy though
8:59
individually that that really relates to
9:01
this they came up to us and told us a
9:03
story about my dad doing something for
9:05
him that that he didn't even know my dad
9:07
did it right he had to like dig deep and
9:10
figure out that my dad had done this
9:11
thing to begin with and bless this
9:13
person and created a moment of impact
9:16
for them and it changed his literal life
9:18
he went he told me he said i went home
9:21
and i told my wife that i'd been having
9:23
an affair
9:24
and he said and she stayed with me god
9:25
bless her she stayed with me and he said
9:27
we've been together for like another 20
9:28
plus years and we have four kids and
9:31
we're extremely happy but if i if your
9:32
dad hadn't motivated me to get out of
9:34
this disgusting lifestyle that was in
9:37
and this these things that were nagging
9:39
at me deep in my soul by doing one
9:41
simple thing for me
9:42
one simple thing my life would never be
9:44
to be the same i probably wouldn't even
9:46
be standing here today that is extremely
9:48
powerful my dad sold copy machines
9:50
ladies and gentlemen right you have a
9:52
medium at your fingertips in all
9:54
instances of these types of things this
9:57
is more than ghosting right people
9:58
ghosts because of the the simple
10:00
examples that we've given but they they
10:02
technically ghost because they're living
10:04
their life
10:05
and we forget that so often and so i
10:08
love leslie's example and i think it's
10:09
just really important that we think so
10:11
much deeper than all this and that we
10:13
rebel against the status quo and the
10:14
mediocre and the typical that
10:16
everybody tells us we have to be doing
10:18
send a value proposition uh throw a
10:21
couple white papers over there and let
10:23
them read those like no give people an
10:25
experience show your heart sink your
10:27
teeth into those moments and not in a
10:29
weird way right but in a very romantic
10:31
way in the from the perspective of that
10:33
i am giving everything i have to this
10:35
thing right here and i promise you that
10:38
what you get as a result will be beyond
10:40
any expectation that you ever came in
10:41
with something that all this talk about
10:43
being a person and being proactive and
10:45
sort of and just sort of shooting them
10:46
straight that really rings true for me
10:48
is what we talk about ambition with
10:50
calling a spade a spade and really
10:52
breaking the fourth wall um and just not
10:54
putting up a front we're people there's
10:56
a reason that people do this job and
10:58
machines don't it's person to person and
11:00
the relationships is entirely what makes
11:02
or breaks a sale or makes or breaks a
11:04
relationship between you and yourself
11:05
and a prospect so what i've found that
11:08
like using this in my my calls as an sdr
11:12
and my deals as an ae is labeling and
11:14
really just sort of calling something
11:15
what it is and shooting them straight
11:17
and putting the ball in their court
11:18
which is like
11:19
it sounds like the timing's less than
11:20
ideal are we still interested in
11:22
continuing the conversation or should i
11:24
plan on reaching back out time a lot
11:25
down the line if not happy to part ways
11:28
as friends or in my case i guess now
11:29
it'll be happy to send a magician your
11:31
way with a business card for your
11:32
reference uh but really taking the
11:34
pressure off you can use your
11:36
personality i know a lot of our sdrs at
11:38
ambition use this with the memes and the
11:40
gifts and that really sets us apart but
11:42
is there anything that you can think of
11:43
as to why we uh why we why this time
11:45
frame wouldn't work for you or why we
11:47
can't move forward and again really
11:49
really putting the the ball back in
11:50
their court there
