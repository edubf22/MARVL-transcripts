this might shock you when someone says
0:02
hey send me an email when you're cold
0:04
calling you get fired up you're like oh
0:06
this is going to be great i'm getting a
0:07
response and i got a sad thing to tell
0:09
you you're most likely not going to get
0:11
a response at all with this objection
0:14
this is morgan j ingram from cell better
0:16
and you have to subscribe to the channel
0:19
if you want to enhance your sales career
0:20
i think that's why you're here so you
0:22
might want to click that button now
0:23
let's go into how do you deal with this
0:26
objection when someone says send me an
0:28
email this one is my least favorite
0:32
every time i heard it when i was a sales
0:34
rep and even today i used to get really
0:36
fired up i was like oh yeah let me send
0:38
an email like they're going to respond
0:39
i'm getting a lot of meetings and then
0:41
all you hear is nothing crickets and
0:43
you're like
0:44
sucks i should go outside people can
0:46
take a walk i'm done with this right so
0:49
how do you do this with moving forward
0:50
we don't want you to cry we want you to
0:52
feel great and so how you go about this
0:54
objection is you have to ask a couple of
0:57
questions
0:58
and with all objections you have to ask
1:00
larry questions to truly uncover what is
1:03
going on so the first question you want
1:05
to ask is hey
1:07
out of curiosity what type of content
1:11
would you like to see
1:12
in this email most people don't ask this
1:14
question they just send an email that's
1:16
generic and then it gets deleted it
1:17
doesn't matter so typically the prospect
1:19
will respond and give you a couple bit
1:21
of information now i know some of you
1:23
out there like morgan what if they say
1:24
no like what do i do i got you so when
1:27
this happens you're gonna say hey look
1:30
when people don't give me the exact
1:32
information they're looking for in a
1:34
follow-up email it isn't looking like
1:36
spam to them it isn't getting deleted
1:38
and it wastes both of our times so
1:40
what exactly are you looking for in this
1:43
email that way they'll acknowledge you
1:45
they'll be like okay i don't want to get
1:46
spam i don't want to get blown up nobody
1:47
wants that right i don't think you do so
1:49
now what we can do is follow up with
1:52
information and this part is where we're
1:54
gonna do a give get so if you're new to
1:56
sales a give get is basically i'm gonna
1:58
give you something in this case
2:00
information to get something in return
2:02
which is i want a meeting so
2:04
what i'm gonna say here is i'm to send
2:07
you an email with all the information
2:09
that you just talked about however what
2:11
we found to be best with people i talk
2:12
to like yourself is to set up a
2:14
conversation with you next wednesday
2:17
three o'clock it looks like i'm open so
2:19
that we can talk about this information
2:21
does that sound fair and now people are
2:23
like wow this is incredible i'm gonna
2:25
get content right and then also as well
2:28
we can book the meeting for next
2:31
wednesday and now we're good to go so
2:33
that is the way that you handle send me
2:36
an email i don't want any of y'all to
2:37
not do it this way and be like morgan is
2:40
stuck no we want to be able to get and
2:42
overcome this objection and if you want
2:44
