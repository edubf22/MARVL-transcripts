0:00
okay so let's dive in so um bring up a
0:03
slide we're gonna start with why we
0:05
should stop touching base checking in
0:08
and what we're gonna stay instead and i
0:10
would like meg if you don't mind i feel
0:13
like you do an awesome job of starting
0:15
this early on in the conversation can
0:17
you tell us a little bit more about that
0:18
absolutely so that's actually the key to
0:20
this whole thing is starting it early on
0:23
in the process so
0:24
when you have that first call with a
0:27
prospect even if it's like super early
0:29
on maybe it's a cold call maybe you're
0:31
in like your first discovery call you've
0:33
got to start early on holding them
0:36
accountable because what it does
0:38
is it puts them in a position where
0:40
they're expecting you
0:42
to actually communicate with them but
0:44
you're expecting something back from
0:47
them so a couple of things that i do
0:49
again early on often and right off the
0:51
bat one of my favorite things to do is
0:53
when i'm sending an email right we send
0:55
emails all day long
0:57
i skip the niceties so
0:59
i don't necessarily put in a lot of
1:01
stuff about like the weather
1:03
or like my sports team
1:05
or whatever
1:06
and and i'm not doing it because i'm
1:08
being mean what i'm doing is doing it
1:09
because i want them to read exactly what
1:13
i want
1:14
where i want it there was some data i
1:16
saw the other day and this is probably a
1:18
little bit older now i bet you the
1:19
prince percentage is even higher but 80
1:22
percent of email is read on a mobile
1:24
device
1:25
so if you're thinking about reading that
1:27
email on a mobile device how many
1:28
scrolls are you going to go through
1:30
right i got one maybe two before i like
1:33
lose track and decide to go to another
1:35
email right so what we want to do is put
1:37
that call to action
1:39
right up front what you're doing is
1:40
conditioning the prospect early on that
1:44
you're going to be direct you're going
1:45
to be upfront not annoying but you're
1:48
going to give them what they want yep i
1:50
agree and i think this could also depend
1:52
on where you are in the sales cycle
1:54
right oh 100
1:55
if you're having a conversation with
1:56
someone and you know them and you've
1:58
already had
1:59
multiple conversations i'm more likely
2:01
to skip the formalities skip the
2:03
niceties maybe if we're new if it's a
2:04
cold message
2:06
add in a little bit sure
2:09
a little bit we can a b split test that
2:11
check it out absolutely i really like
2:13
adrian mentioned in the chat over here
2:16
uh am i being a nuisance yet right and
2:18
getting that response back and saying
2:21
you know
2:22
yeah yes
2:23
even if it is but it's a response yeah
2:25
yeah and i know we don't always
2:26
celebrate right the negative but it's a
2:28
response yeah it's a response and so
2:31
that it's something we're going to talk
2:32
about a little bit more about the idea
2:34
of gauging engagement right so
2:36
our job is to figure out you know are
2:38
these people interested in having
2:40
conversations with us right are they
2:41
interested in actually exchanging a
2:43
dialogue but the way that you do that is
2:46
like getting them on the hook early on
2:48
and letting them know that you are in
2:51
control so one of the things that i am
2:53
just like a huge believer in
2:55
is the fact that like
2:57
you control the sales process the sales
2:59
process does not control you you control
3:01
the prospect the prospect does not
3:03
control you and if you keep that in the
3:05
back of your head you're not going to be
3:07
annoying you're going to be in charge
3:08
you're going to exude confidence and
3:10
when you do that you actually are coming
3:13
across as somebody that is again in
3:15
control has power has authority and
3:17
that's actually what the prospect wants
3:18
at the end of the day right so
3:20
i'm all about keeping it short
3:23
keeping it sweet
3:24
avoiding the you know the nicest that
3:26
doesn't mean that you're you know you
3:28
have to be like this is a really
3:30
annoying thing and please i need you to
3:31
respond right now that's it but you can
3:33
skip the whole like you know
3:36
stuff in the front that we don't need
3:38
how many of you and this isn't a poll so
3:40
i'm rhetorically just asking you all
3:42
this question you can put in the chat
3:43
but yeah how many of you literally start
3:45
your emails with hope you're having a
3:46
great day
3:47
or
3:48
you know
3:49
hope things are going well
3:53
it's not my favorite are you the person
3:55
um
3:56
tell me in the chat like if this is you
3:58
or you know somebody you call them and
4:01
they won't pick up the phone but they'll
4:03
text you back right away yeah or
4:06
you text them and they don't respond but
4:08
they are
4:09
messaging you on instagram
4:12
right exactly like everyone has their
4:14
own way of communication if we're
4:16
walking down this hallway and each of
4:19
our prospects is on a hallway we gotta
4:21
try all the doors right we have to try
4:23
all of them we gotta try email yeah
4:25
email's filled with all these people
4:28
knocking on their ears like email's the
4:30
easiest thing to do you can set them up
4:31
send them out good to go yeah but we got
4:34
to try different things we have to see
4:35
what people like and everyone's
4:36
different what's your favorite way for
4:38
me to get a hold of you video
4:40
video yep so well i mean text me but
4:43
you'd have to have my number i mean you
4:45
do you have to have you have to have a
4:46
proof you have to have approval to text
4:48
me just kidding um
4:52
video is really key for me so and i know
4:55
a lot of you mentioned a couple you
4:56
mentioned your account managers you're
4:57
in cs and so this is something that i
5:00
want to point out directly to you
5:03
video communication to your customer
5:06
base is going to give you such a
5:08
positive result i can't begin to tell
5:10
you at first it's going to feel
5:12
awkward and weird and the same thing
5:14
goes for net new sales too like really
5:16
anyone in the room if you haven't tried
5:17
video before i use video in
5:20
a variety of different things whether
5:21
it's to explain like a particularly long
5:24
email that maybe i need to write out
5:26
with like next steps i'll just do like a
5:27
video short
5:29
um i'll do like from an onboarding
5:31
perspective if i need them to just know
5:33
like two or three different details i'll
5:36
do that like it's a great way to kind of
5:38
get your face literally in front of them
5:42
right
5:43
uh and then also just mix it up and it
5:46
almost gives them permission
5:48
to try something new too which i like
5:50
because it can get
5:52
like
5:53
those doors are scary yeah you know you
5:55
don't know what's coming and it's nice
5:57
to sort of build
5:58
out a little bit of that consistency and
6:00
have that kind of okay i'm gonna try
6:02
video great you're gonna try video
6:05
awesome right
6:06
yeah yeah what is a like quick tip to
6:09
get more comfortable on video maybe some
6:12
practice tips there because it's not
6:14
easy in the beginning we all know that
6:16
yep yep
6:17
so you know and embrace the awkward um i
6:20
tried it out
6:22
a couple years ago at first and i just
6:23
did it with colleagues so i'd send like
6:25
video messages i'd get first and
6:26
foremost just like hold the phone in a
6:28
place that was comfortable then i
6:30
actually invested in like a selfie stick
6:32
and then i invested in a tripod you've
6:35
got a few
6:36
shout outs yeah
6:37
uh and i i did the things that kind of
6:40
made me feel comfortable the biggest
6:42
thing i can tell you is don't overthink
6:44
it don't script it have a conversation
6:47
into the camera get out your points if
6:50
you need to have like a lot of apps have
6:52
like room for notes so if you just need
6:54
to put like a couple of talking points
6:55
do that practice and it's going to be
6:58
great now listen if you do practice and
7:00
you're sending it and you're like god
7:03
that's gross i don't want to ever do
7:04
that again i'm going to challenge you to
7:06
do it again keep trying keep trying it
7:08
um you're going to you got to get over
7:10
the hump you got to get over the initial
7:13
and then once you do that it's awesome
7:15
it truly has changed the way not only
7:18
how i sell but just how i communicate
7:20
with our existing clients your sample
7:21
size like my first sample size i sent
7:23
three videos and i was like nope not
7:25
doing it
7:26
you gotta you have to like really have a
7:28
larger sample size right but i will say
7:30
too for those of you i know there's a
7:32
lot of people chiming in about video and
7:34
we use a variation vidyard um also like
7:37
direct through linkedin messaging if
7:39
you're first degree connected with them
7:41
i would say the other thing to try when
7:43
we're talking about channels
7:45
is
7:46
audio messages
7:48
and
7:49
for me it's performing really similar so
7:51
if you're not comfortable
7:53
like for me it's always like i open my
7:54
phone and i see all of my chins looking
7:57
back and i'm like staring there like my
7:59
phone and i'm like oh no i never want to
8:00
open my phone again my camera just
8:02
looked at me so if you like flip your
8:04
phone around if you want to try video or
8:06
go audio message yeah audio message it's
8:09
um it's performing at the same open and
8:12
response rate for me personally
8:14
and i know that's a little bit different
8:16
for everyone cut you off at 60 seconds
8:18
if you're using linkedin so you're not
8:20
going to go on for too long yeah
8:23
well i try that i actually have not been
8:24
using audio as much does anyone audio
8:27
text with their family or their friends
8:30
um just like on and text message i know
8:32
is a little bit different but you can
8:33
send a linkedin audio voice note as well
8:36
my little sister does that in our
8:37
siblings text she touched she she's a
8:40
big i don't think she's watching this
8:41
but if she had if she was i love your
8:44
audio text thank you
8:46
i think it's it's different and that's a
8:48
big piece of it is just showing up
8:51
different than everyone else who's in
8:53
there right
8:54
it's just such it's an overpopulated
8:56
space right now and
8:58
you know that certainly depends on the
8:59
industry that you're selling in to and
9:01
the industry that you're coming from if
9:03
you're selling in a sas space right now
9:05
to a private equity backed firm you are
9:07
in a very tight marketplace at this
9:10
moment in time so you've got to come up
9:12
with ways to differentiate yourself and
9:14
to stand out and to provide value i
9:16
think the biggest thing
9:18
is having some sort of
9:21
plan some sort of approach and a lot of
9:24
people do but typically that consists of
9:26
the two channels so let's vary it up
9:29
also most people give up
9:31
too early on there's crazy statistics
9:35
that a lot of us are giving up reaching
9:37
out to a specific organization
9:39
or prospect of ours after
9:42
two three four five touches because we
9:45
run out of things to say
9:47
being able to come up with something
9:48
different every time
9:50
are you interested in this no well how
9:52
about that no okay well how about this
9:54
right so we're coming back with
9:55
something different every time and we're
9:57
trying those different doors in the
9:58
hallway different channels seeing how
10:01
they personally want to be communicated
10:03
with i think also just really being
10:06
familiar with who's the best fit for
10:08
your organization yeah who's the best
10:10
fit
10:11
and and that could be different for my
10:13
organization than it is for me
10:14
personally i know i love prospecting
10:17
into people in engagement and your
10:20
favorite is i love like the talent
10:22
acquisition space industry
10:25
like people management software that
10:27
kind of thing for me those are my peeps
10:28
yeah so just like knowing where people
10:31
you find favor with looking at your past
10:34
wins and seeing if there's some sort of
10:36
pattern that emerges that really helps i
10:39
think
10:41
i know we're coming back to the question
10:43
here i went on a wild ride but coming
10:45
back to your question when we're
10:47
thinking about being persistent there
10:48
let them know
10:50
at the end of your sequence or cadence
10:52
whatever you're doing just be like hey
10:54
it looks like this isn't a priority for
10:56
you right now no biggie
10:58
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna let you be i know
11:00
a few people mentioned humor in the chat
11:02
here um i'm gonna let you be for a
11:04
little bit but i'll be back in three
11:06
months or
11:07
i'll be back in a couple months and see
11:09
if it's a better time for you right even
11:10
if they've never responded you're
11:12
managing their expectations right yeah
11:14
look at that full circle there i know
11:16
that was amazing i'm a big fan of one
11:18
word update question mark um
11:20
uh
11:22
next steps um question mark
11:25
feedback
11:26
question mark um
11:29
i've been known to want to send other
11:31
things and subject lines that probably
11:32
are not appropriate
11:34
yeah um
11:35
but those were the ones that come to
11:37
mind yeah those are great i don't use
11:39
checking in following up
11:41
that's not true i will use following up
11:42
if it's truly i actually don't use
11:44
following up i do follow up like this is
11:47
the follow-up email
11:49
but i only do that if i'm literally
11:51
sending
11:52
a follow-up email from a big call
11:54
otherwise if it's something else i use
11:56
update
11:57
that kind of thing yep recap on our
11:58
conversation yep um i like that and
12:01
that's me again
12:03
what about dropping emojis in that
12:05
subject line i just saw that in the chat
12:07
i
12:08
i think this varies and it's like
12:09
personal comfort level
12:11
i see some people do phenomenal with
12:13
this
12:14
and it stands out in an
12:17
a business email inbox you have a ton of
12:19
them in your gmail account or a yahoo
12:22
hotmail i don't know where people where
12:25
people at these days but you have a lot
12:27
of them in your personal account but not
12:28
so much in business i see i think
12:30
there's probably like a work appropriate
12:32
emoji list somewhere like what can be
12:34
used i don't feel comfortable with it
12:36
but i do love symbols so the straight
12:38
line down or like a slider
12:42
yeah yeah greater than less than right
12:44
that's what i was going for um plus i i
12:46
think it just stands out a little bit
12:48
different pattern interrupt yeah yeah
12:50
yeah absolutely i'm not a huge
12:53
emoji
12:54
symbols over emojis for you 100 symbols
12:57
over emojis
