0:00
cool what's going on everybody welcome
0:02
I'm so excited for this session by the
0:04
way
0:05
um yeah I have a couple tips on this so
0:07
when I'm doing prep for a discovery call
0:10
one of the big things that I do that I
0:12
think is a little bit different is I'm
0:14
taking notes in the form of questions so
0:17
I'm thinking about what are the
0:18
different triggers for the thing that I
0:20
sell that I want to point out and have a
0:22
conversation with the buyer about and
0:24
what I don't want to do is take notes
0:26
where it's like okay they had an event
0:28
uh their their customer event last month
0:31
and oh this person was on a podcast
0:33
recently where they talked about needing
0:36
better data analytics and I sell a data
0:37
analytics tool what I don't want to be
0:39
doing is being in the heat of Battle of
0:41
that Discovery call and trying to figure
0:44
out okay they talked about Dana
0:46
analytics how am I going to turn that
0:48
into a discovery question I want to do
0:50
all of that prep work up front so I'm
0:52
actually taking prep notes of the
0:55
questions I'm going to ask them I'm not
0:57
going to get to every single question
0:58
but my idea here is I want want to save
1:01
cognitive brain power which I have a
1:03
limited amount of
1:04
um for for better stuff than those
1:06
questions so that's a really big one
1:09
um the other thing that I think about is
1:11
I really want to walk into that meeting
1:13
knowing what's top of mind for that
1:15
customer and so what I'm going to do is
1:18
I want to find recent LinkedIn posts
1:20
that they made a recent podcast that
1:22
they were on if I can find a YouTube
1:23
clip that they did recently my whole
1:26
goal is to figure out like what's top of
1:28
mind for this point and for this person
1:30
and point that out hey I listened to
1:32
your um your your your webinar recording
1:35
on the sell better webinar series and I
1:38
heard you say this even if it's like not
1:40
totally related to my thing I want to
1:42
signal to them that I have done my
1:44
homework because people will reciprocate
1:47
that effort the demonstration of hey I
1:50
did my work folks will say all right
1:51
this person's trying and they'll give
1:53
you way way more than if you go in and
1:56
it's obvious you haven't done your work
1:58
Charles I know you had great point about
2:01
industry can you tell us a little bit
2:03
more about that yeah I love the do we
2:05
have to do research option that is that
2:07
is I love that I love that uh yeah so
2:12
I'm gonna say two things uh one of three
2:15
things one I love Nick sigowski so he's
2:17
got great great insights so thank you
2:18
very much I learned from Nick every
2:20
single time I speak with him the second
2:22
thing I'll say is
2:25
um you know there's we should all be at
2:28
the risk of stating the obvious
2:30
there are we should be paying attention
2:32
to tracking and monitoring industry
2:36
focused research so there's there's
2:40
research on the company that we're about
2:42
to have a conversation with and there's
2:43
research on the people that we're about
2:46
to talk to all very important
2:49
um with that said we should also be
2:52
researching the industry period in
2:56
general
2:57
in between calls that's the type of
3:00
research I'm talking about the
3:01
in-between research uh similar to
3:04
nurturing for prospects but we're
3:06
nurturing our minds for ourselves and so
3:10
um signing up for if it's uh private and
3:13
just giving a a one industry as an
3:16
example
3:18
um if it's the private Equity world or
3:21
landscape or if it's a sector that any
3:24
of you are focused on the health care
3:25
sector I'm going to look at news
3:27
specific journals and sources that only
3:31
talk about health care or that only talk
3:33
about private Equity
3:35
um hopefully if you're selling hopefully
3:38
you're liking what you're selling and if
3:40
you're liking what you're selling you're
3:41
going to like reading about what you're
3:43
selling and so definitely that is a very
3:46
very big part of research because a lot
3:48
of times you'll bring that up in a
3:50
conversation with any company with any
3:53
Prospect oh I just saw this happen in
3:55
the industry I'm also not just in the
3:58
know about you I'm in the know about the
4:00
industry I'm going to know I'm going to
4:02
know about your peers I'm going to know
4:04
about companies in your portfolio and
4:07
then know about the industry that's a
4:09
big part of the research that is
4:10
important for us as account executives
4:14
um and the uh the second thing I wanted
4:17
to add with regard to uh to prep is you
4:22
know what I think I may have put those
4:24
two in one because I totally am blanking
4:26
out oh here it comes here it comes the
4:28
second item the second item is I've
4:31
talked to Nick sugowski about this
4:34
um research is important okay but it's
4:37
important for us as AES or sdrs not to
4:40
overburden ourselves because if we do
4:44
too much and feel like we have to show
4:47
credibility then we end up talking more
4:49
than we would have liked or we just end
4:52
up you know trying to uh prove to our
4:56
Prospect we are credible and we know
4:58
we're all knowing take it easy
5:01
have this is an art as much as it is a
5:04
science know enough to be dangerous so
5:06
don't overburden yourself place a lot of
5:08
the burden on the prospects as well
5:09
that's what I have to say about research
5:11
what we have next we want to know the
5:13
techniques you want to be asking your
5:16
the techniques you you gotta you gotta
5:18
really lean into like the questions you
5:20
got to be asking that lean into your
5:22
solution
5:23
so tell me Charles what do you have
5:27
around this you got any any uh thoughts
5:29
that come into us right away yeah thank
5:32
you Adrian I want to point out a very
5:33
subtle point a very important point we
5:36
are not talking about leading questions
5:41
um that's not what we're talking about
5:42
leading questions are I'm asking you
5:45
this question knowing this Prospect is
5:47
going to answer it in the following way
5:49
that is totally self-serving people
5:52
catch on to that
5:54
um that's not what we're talking about
5:55
we're talking about
5:58
leading with questions that will prime a
6:03
very thoughtful and effective
6:05
conversation so what does that mean in
6:08
English
6:08
that means at the beginning of any
6:11
conversation
6:13
it's always very important we learn that
6:15
context is King okay in sales I think
6:19
John barrows talks a lot about that so
6:21
in the beginning of this of the
6:22
conversation we kind of want to know
6:24
like where where are where are we at
6:27
where are we at so let's assume without
6:30
getting into heavy granularity
6:32
uh me and sagelski hey Nick nice to
6:34
connect uh blah blah blah where you're
6:37
from okay uh I was down till you know
6:40
until 2 30 is that or to three o'clock
6:42
that's time till that time still work
6:44
for you yeah sure and then I might say
6:47
by the way Nick you know just to make
6:48
sure we're we're on the on the same page
6:51
here I was just curious to what extent
6:53
you have familiarity with our
6:54
organization I'm not sure if you've done
6:57
research or what you know if you spoke
6:58
with us in the past Etc now most
7:01
prospects will either say I don't have
7:04
any familiar or any or no I have some
7:06
familiarity but not enough tell me more
7:08
like rarely almost never someone gonna
7:11
be like yeah I know everything about you
7:13
guys okay so why are we talking right oh
7:16
right so then after I get some Center
7:18
like where are they at no you can tell
7:20
me a little bit yeah I don't really know
7:22
everything about you guys then I might
7:24
throw in and ask for permission I love
7:25
asking for permission by the way it's
7:28
very inviting it pulls people in and
7:31
doesn't push people away I might say
7:33
Nick cool so before we kick off the
7:35
conversation here would it be all right
7:36
if I just give you some high level
7:37
context around what we do and maybe a
7:40
little context as to why I reached out
7:41
to you yeah sure great and then I'm
7:45
going to start with something called a
7:46
positioning statement
7:48
um a positioning statement less less
7:52
than 30 seconds and what it is is
7:55
I'm telling my Prospect what we do in
7:59
less than 30 seconds but I'm not telling
8:02
them what we do I'm really telling them
8:04
why people talk to us right on sales a
8:07
lot of us get like uh stuck on oh we are
8:12
uh we're a platform we're a tool we're
8:15
we're this like no one cares what you
8:17
it's like I'm a human being okay like
8:19
we'll get to that right they're very
8:21
stuck on what we are and they're very
8:24
stuck on how we do things
8:27
right and those two oh this is how we do
8:30
no one cares about how you do things or
8:33
what you are
8:34
without
8:36
being interested in what problems people
8:39
talk to you about oh that's interesting
8:41
then if I know that like oh so what do
8:44
you guys do
8:45
how do you do that right that comes much
8:46
later so the positioning statement might
8:49
sound like great so so Nick just to give
8:51
you some
8:52
some some quick context what we do is
8:54
really simple I'll talk about CB
8:57
insights for a second uh our clients
9:00
come to us really to talk about three
9:02
main topics one
9:05
getting better coverage in a certain
9:06
industry even if that's a spec even if
9:09
they're specialists in that area because
9:11
many times they can miss out on a
9:12
relevant company that could have been
9:14
really impactful for them they talk to
9:16
us a lot about that a lot of our clients
9:18
want to understand
9:19
how they can better
9:23
be more accurate how could they get how
9:25
they could be more accurate when it
9:26
comes to data because they find
9:27
themselves spending a lot of time on
9:29
data that actually wasn't accurate which
9:31
has incorrectly affected their strategy
9:34
and the third topic people like to talk
9:36
about with us is just to understand what
9:39
trends are happening within certain
9:41
emerging technology that they had no
9:43
idea about that could really be a
9:45
benefit for their organization when it
9:47
comes to inorganic growth so those are
9:49
some three topics that people want to
9:51
talk to us about which we help solve for
9:53
I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions
9:55
on that which I'm happy to answer with
9:58
that said it seems that now I'm in
10:00
transitioning totally it seems that you
10:02
do this my guess is that you track
10:04
emerging technology companies which is
10:06
the reason why I had reached out to in
10:08
the first place based on my research I
10:10
saw you guys came up with a new product
10:12
line or a new initiative and my
10:14
hypothesis was that hey this is
10:16
something that you're doing already
10:17
correct me if I'm wrong and B to the
10:19
extent that you are doing it I'd love to
10:22
understand how that works how you think
10:23
about it and then we can take it from
10:25
there if that works for you so it's like
10:27
my positioning statement right
10:28
immediately transitioning into talking
10:31
about them not never saying a word about
10:33
who we are never saying a word about
10:35
what we do all I said was why people
10:37
talk to us in the first place and now my
10:39
immediate question is focused on them
10:42
while I've already primed thoughtfully
10:45
the conversation around hopefully our
10:48
solution in order to avoid them telling
10:51
me Oh this is our company we were 20
10:55
years old and we've all we've all
10:57
experienced all of us and we all will
10:59
continue to experience as AES and sdrs
11:02
Prospects who just talk about nothing
11:04
nothing for 15 20 minutes you're sitting
11:07
on the phone like what am I doing it is
11:09
our responsibility to prime the pump so
11:10
that's how I would start a conversation
11:12
like that now I know one thing that has
11:15
to do with intention is you also want to
11:17
avoid certain questions and I want to
11:20
know from everyone in the audience we
11:22
have a poll for you guys here do you
11:24
guys avoid any type of questions in your
11:28
Discovery you know you just gotta fire
11:30
away with no regard or do you actually
11:32
just be like I don't want to ask this
11:34
could be touchy I know we mentioned we
11:37
want to be sure about that that why word
11:40
why is that Nick did you have something
11:42
to touch on that well you're gonna ask
11:44
me why is that uh yeah so the word the
11:48
word why is a double-edged sword
11:52
it can be your best friend in a sales
11:55
conversation and it can also be your
11:58
worst enemy in a sales conversation
12:01
the word why
12:04
asks the other person to defend their
12:09
position on what that question is about
12:12
so if I say to Charles Charles why are
12:14
you using a virtual background today
12:17
well now Charles has to Charles has to
12:19
justify why he's using a virtual
12:22
background today which there's nothing
12:23
wrong with I think your background looks
12:24
really nice today Charles
12:26
if I ask the customer about their
12:30
current stay I say you know why are you
12:32
doing things like that today you know
12:34
they're telling me Oh they have to
12:36
defend that that statement so if any
12:38
time you're using the word why you don't
12:40
want to put the person on the defensive
12:43
the one time you want to have somebody
12:45
defend something is when they're
12:46
justifying why they're looking into your
12:49
thing so
12:51
if they're telling me Oh Our systems you
12:53
know I was selling Law Firm time
12:55
tracking software for a while and if
12:56
they told me oh you know the lawyers are
12:58
frustrated and we're not efficient
12:59
enough and things are really manual and
13:01
I say well why are you using the system
13:03
well now they're going to defend the
13:05
choice to use that system in the first
13:06
place well the managing partner said we
13:08
had to get this and he used it before
13:10
and well now they're just justifying the
13:11
reason that they bought that system that
13:13
they had originally said they were
13:14
trying to change in the first place well
13:16
that's not good instead I want to say
13:19
well you know gosh usually when I talk
13:22
to law firms and they're telling me
13:23
about their time tracking software
13:25
sometimes lawyers are really wedded to
13:27
that stuff and making a change is a
13:29
pretty big deal I guess
13:31
why even have a conversation with a firm
13:33
like ours about making this sort of
13:35
change that question now they have to
13:37
defend their reason for wanting to make
13:40
a change and when you get somebody to
13:42
defend their reason for wanting to make
13:44
a change things often go in your way
13:46
because now you understand their true
13:48
motivations so you got to be careful
13:50
with why you don't want them to defend
13:52
the wrong thing
13:54
uh amazing Insight Nick in terms of
13:57
avoiding uh defending the wrong thing
14:00
what's interesting about the word the
14:03
word why is
14:06
um a lesser known insight about the word
14:08
why is why the word y can be a grand
14:13
slam home run
14:15
if you ask the prospect
14:19
why they think
14:23
that something is the case or why they
14:25
feel that's the case that's just a
14:28
genius question it can't go wrong so I'm
14:30
going to botch what Nick said but if if
14:32
a prospect was like yeah we're working
14:34
with all these systems and it's really
14:36
inefficient and it's really
14:38
um you know frustrating people and we're
14:41
having a hard time with it and I say
14:42
that's interesting why do you feel
14:44
that's the case or that's really why do
14:46
you think that's why do you think that's
14:48
happening
14:48
that's it and sometimes they'll be like
14:52
I don't know
14:53
you know okay you know what why do you
14:56
feel that even by the way even if you're
14:57
having a conversation just about about
14:59
the industry
15:00
that has nothing to do with them they
15:02
might want to talk to you about oh yeah
15:03
we just saw these this company come come
15:06
out with a product line you know where
15:08
where a fan you know where we that's
15:10
something that we want to do and I might
15:11
be like
15:12
you know what why do you like their what
15:15
or this might be like what do you like
15:17
about their initiative about maybe like
15:18
why do you feel like that's something
15:20
you've been falling behind on
15:23
you know why do you feel or why do you
15:25
think and then finish that sentence is a
15:27
slant on against the emotional heart of
15:29
the conversation
15:31
um so that's just to tag on to what Nick
15:32
was saying the other thing about like a
15:34
lot of times people ask me like Charles
15:36
what are some questions I would never
15:37
ask and this is my philosophy on
15:40
questions
15:42
I don't believe there's such a thing as
15:45
a bad question objectively in isolation
15:49
Okay I do think there is such a thing as
15:52
a bad way to ask a question because if
15:55
you know how to ask questions in
15:57
Discovery you can ask any question you
15:59
want and none of them will be bad it's
16:02
bad if the delivery is bad right if the
16:06
way that Nick talked about why right why
16:08
is your background blurry right there's
16:10
there's a way that's a bad question but
16:12
he can ask it in a better way and so
16:14
there are always better ways to ask any
16:16
questions that we want to ask part of
16:18
the list that's on the on the slide is
16:22
um you know not asking sometimes AES or
16:24
scrs will ask questions this is a big
16:26
usually it's more of the newer the newer
16:29
folks they ask questions that they don't
16:31
understand the question
16:32
it's like that's a very high level
16:34
question that some people ask here to be
16:36
inside you know can you help me
16:37
understand Bob what your deliverable is
16:39
as a team and I'm walking through a a
16:42
call I'm having a session with an AE I'm
16:44
like what does that mean what does that
16:45
mean you're deliverable
16:47
and he's like I don't really know
16:50
so I'm like why would you ask a question
16:51
that you don't know what it means
16:53
because then the prospect is going to do
16:56
one of two things they're going to say
16:58
well what does that mean and you're like
16:59
oh crap right or the prospect's not
17:02
going to give you a good answer and
17:05
you're like oh cool great we
17:06
accomplished nothing in the past three
17:07
minutes I'm gonna move to the next one
17:09
understand with the meaning of your
17:12
question and always understand why
17:14
you're asking it because if the prospect
17:16
doesn't understand why I wish they
17:18
shouldn't based on what we just talked
17:19
about giving reasons for questions you
17:21
know why you're asking it
