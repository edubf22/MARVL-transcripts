Dorothy let me uh bring up this example
0:04
for us so
0:06
what exactly is this graph telling us
0:10
so what we're seeing from our data right
0:13
so what lavender does is we're analyzing
0:15
about 3.5 million emails a month and so
0:19
we've kind of looked at how that could
0:21
correlate to emails for LinkedIn DMS and
0:25
so we're seeing that when you're in this
0:27
20 to 50 word range your chances of
0:31
getting a replies much higher so up to
0:33
like 20 plus percent if you keep your
0:35
emails like super short
0:38
um the way like I like to paint this
0:40
pictures and I talked about this like
0:42
right before the what makes me most
0:44
excited is like taking real life
0:46
situations and putting into the digital
0:48
space right so if we think about what
0:50
LinkedIn actually could be is like a a
0:54
conference or a water cooler space right
0:57
so I don't know what's going on but I've
1:00
also received a lot of like crazy emails
1:03
that end up in my other but uh when
1:05
y'all pitch it's just like this long
1:07
message and you you would never do that
1:10
in real life to like somebody you meet
1:13
at a conference or
1:16
um you know a friend of a friend or
1:18
something that's you don't send like an
1:21
essay over to that person
1:24
um you kind of you know it's it's really
1:26
you make this this observation about the
1:29
landscape or that conversation and like
1:31
hey look I noticed you might be
1:33
interested in this
1:35
would that could we like
1:38
you know continuous conversation
1:40
elsewhere something like that but it's
1:43
it's really funny how we completely
1:46
throw like regular social cues out the
1:50
door uh in the digital space
1:53
um and we also like make I don't know I
1:56
don't know if we're getting like
1:57
bombarded by like marketing fluff in her
1:59
head or we're we're being taught like
2:01
really big words around our product but
2:04
when you're writing these messages most
2:06
people are writing at like a 10th grade
2:08
level and they're using really large
2:10
words to sound smart when you would
2:14
never say that to a friend or another
2:17
person you know and so keep me around
2:19
that fifth grade reading level actually
2:21
increases reply rates by about 50
2:23
percent wow yeah to be a human is all I
2:27
gotta say there he's human and if you
2:30
guys want to learn more about this we
2:32
actually have the article where this
2:35
graph came from that goes into more
2:36
details to why you should keep your
2:38
messages short and gives you just some
2:41
statistics that you guys can look at I'm
2:43
going to go ahead and drop it in the
2:44
chat so be sure to check that out now
2:47
Chad I know you had an example here as
2:49
well about keeping things short and
2:52
concise you mind speaking more on this
2:54
yeah I mean these are some examples of
2:56
like messages we'll send
2:58
um the first one like we were talking
3:00
about
3:01
um shout out Vicky who helped sets up
3:04
these webinars that's where the name
3:06
came from uh but yeah it's like the
3:09
second message for example congrats on
3:11
hiring X and Y call out this if that's
3:14
like a buying trigger using calling out
3:15
the specific people
3:17
um again it's following that rule of
3:19
seeking to educate not book a meeting or
3:22
seeking to like provide value that sort
3:24
of thing and then when you're emailing
3:26
calling that's when you book a meeting
3:28
because you you know built that
3:29
familiarity
3:31
um I see a lot of people asking for like
3:33
what's the best template to use on
3:34
LinkedIn I don't there's no like best
3:37
template right because whatever template
3:38
works is gonna you know dry up in three
3:41
months because everybody's using it and
3:42
everybody gets used to it and so I think
3:44
it's like best to have these Frameworks
3:46
and these things in mind that we're
3:47
talking about which is like Dorothy
3:49
touchdown I think what is the most
3:50
important thing and it's the hardest to
3:52
master which is making observations on
3:54
LinkedIn and like really doing like the
3:56
Deep work of like figuring out what are
3:59
the buying triggers why should I reach
4:00
out what content are they engaging with
4:02
if I go on your profile Adrian I can see
4:05
in the last week everything you've liked
4:07
and comment it on that's the easiest way
4:09
to figure out what people are interested
4:11
in you can go go to their account click
4:13
activity see what they've liked
4:14
commented on you can get a pretty good
4:15
idea of what they're interested in and
4:16
then use that to make an observation so
4:18
there's no one template that I
4:20
specifically use but I just follow these
4:22
rules of seek and educate right like I'm
4:24
texting to Dorothy's Point using
4:25
observations that sort of thing that's
4:28
what's going to kind of get you results
4:29
on LinkedIn
4:30
nice I might even I might play a little
4:33
Devil's Advocate and say that uh
4:35
educating too hard because I feel like
4:38
some people might take that the wrong
4:39
way it's like being too informative in
4:42
their tones yeah really
4:45
um hurt their chances of getting a reply
4:47
like we've seen that using unsure tones
4:49
actually increases your reply rates
4:51
right like you said you're making an
4:53
observation of like likes and comments
4:56
so you could say something like hey
4:57
looks like you've been really engaging
4:59
with content around
5:01
um email personalization
5:04
and then ask a question around that or
5:07
you know whatever it is your subject is
5:10
um that you sell uh if you that's the
5:13
observation and then ask a question
5:15
around that that's how you start a
5:17
conversation that's what you would do in
5:19
real life too yeah I completely agree
5:21
Dorothy and it ties right back into your
5:23
last point that being more human right
5:25
people like other people who are curious
5:29
right that you're just asking more
5:31
questions you're curious about the
5:33
conversation at hand if someone came up
5:36
to me and they're like spitting facts
5:38
just non-stop like this is all in for
5:40
information and information overload you
5:43
know you kind of don't even want to
5:44
speak to that person anymore after you
5:47
know a certain amount of time yeah it's
5:49
like they're they're talking at you when
5:51
you start submitting too many facts
5:52
right
