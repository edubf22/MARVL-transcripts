sentence,startTime
Dorothy let me uh bring up this example,0:00
for us so,0:04
what exactly is this graph telling us,0:06
so what we're seeing from our data right,0:10
so what lavender does is we're analyzing,0:13
about 3.5 million emails a month and so,0:15
we've kind of looked at how that could,0:19
correlate to emails for LinkedIn DMS and,0:21
so we're seeing that when you're in this,0:25
20 to 50 word range your chances of,0:27
getting a replies much higher so up to,0:31
like 20 plus percent if you keep your,0:33
emails like super short,0:35
um the way like I like to paint this,0:38
pictures and I talked about this like,0:40
right before the what makes me most,0:42
excited is like taking real life,0:44
situations and putting into the digital,0:46
space right so if we think about what,0:48
LinkedIn actually could be is like a a,0:50
conference or a water cooler space right,0:54
so I don't know what's going on but I've,0:57
also received a lot of like crazy emails,1:00
that end up in my other but uh when,1:03
y'all pitch it's just like this long,1:05
message and you you would never do that,1:07
in real life to like somebody you meet,1:10
at a conference or,1:13
um you know a friend of a friend or,1:16
something that's you don't send like an,1:18
essay over to that person,1:21
um you kind of you know it's it's really,1:24
you make this this observation about the,1:26
landscape or that conversation and like,1:29
hey look I noticed you might be,1:31
interested in this,1:33
would that could we like,1:35
you know continuous conversation,1:38
elsewhere something like that but it's,1:40
it's really funny how we completely,1:43
throw like regular social cues out the,1:46
door uh in the digital space,1:50
um and we also like make I don't know I,1:53
don't know if we're getting like,1:56
bombarded by like marketing fluff in her,1:57
head or we're we're being taught like,1:59
really big words around our product but,2:01
when you're writing these messages most,2:04
people are writing at like a 10th grade,2:06
level and they're using really large,2:08
words to sound smart when you would,2:10
never say that to a friend or another,2:14
person you know and so keep me around,2:17
that fifth grade reading level actually,2:19
increases reply rates by about 50,2:21
percent wow yeah to be a human is all I,2:23
gotta say there he's human and if you,2:27
guys want to learn more about this we,2:30
actually have the article where this,2:32
graph came from that goes into more,2:35
details to why you should keep your,2:36
messages short and gives you just some,2:38
statistics that you guys can look at I'm,2:41
going to go ahead and drop it in the,2:43
chat so be sure to check that out now,2:44
Chad I know you had an example here as,2:47
well about keeping things short and,2:49
concise you mind speaking more on this,2:52
yeah I mean these are some examples of,2:54
like messages we'll send,2:56
um the first one like we were talking,2:58
about,3:00
um shout out Vicky who helped sets up,3:01
these webinars that's where the name,3:04
came from uh but yeah it's like the,3:06
second message for example congrats on,3:09
hiring X and Y call out this if that's,3:11
like a buying trigger using calling out,3:14
the specific people,3:15
um again it's following that rule of,3:17
seeking to educate not book a meeting or,3:19
seeking to like provide value that sort,3:22
of thing and then when you're emailing,3:24
calling that's when you book a meeting,3:26
because you you know built that,3:28
familiarity,3:29
um I see a lot of people asking for like,3:31
what's the best template to use on,3:33
LinkedIn I don't there's no like best,3:34
template right because whatever template,3:37
works is gonna you know dry up in three,3:38
months because everybody's using it and,3:41
everybody gets used to it and so I think,3:42
it's like best to have these Frameworks,3:44
and these things in mind that we're,3:46
talking about which is like Dorothy,3:47
touchdown I think what is the most,3:49
important thing and it's the hardest to,3:50
master which is making observations on,3:52
LinkedIn and like really doing like the,3:54
Deep work of like figuring out what are,3:56
the buying triggers why should I reach,3:59
out what content are they engaging with,4:00
if I go on your profile Adrian I can see,4:02
in the last week everything you've liked,4:05
and comment it on that's the easiest way,4:07
to figure out what people are interested,4:09
in you can go go to their account click,4:11
activity see what they've liked,4:13
commented on you can get a pretty good,4:14
idea of what they're interested in and,4:15
then use that to make an observation so,4:16
there's no one template that I,4:18
specifically use but I just follow these,4:20
rules of seek and educate right like I'm,4:22
texting to Dorothy's Point using,4:24
observations that sort of thing that's,4:25
what's going to kind of get you results,4:28
on LinkedIn,4:29
nice I might even I might play a little,4:30
Devil's Advocate and say that uh,4:33
educating too hard because I feel like,4:35
some people might take that the wrong,4:38
way it's like being too informative in,4:39
their tones yeah really,4:42
um hurt their chances of getting a reply,4:45
like we've seen that using unsure tones,4:47
actually increases your reply rates,4:49
right like you said you're making an,4:51
observation of like likes and comments,4:53
so you could say something like hey,4:56
looks like you've been really engaging,4:57
with content around,4:59
um email personalization,5:01
and then ask a question around that or,5:04
you know whatever it is your subject is,5:07
um that you sell uh if you that's the,5:10
observation and then ask a question,5:13
around that that's how you start a,5:15
conversation that's what you would do in,5:17
real life too yeah I completely agree,5:19
Dorothy and it ties right back into your,5:21
last point that being more human right,5:23
people like other people who are curious,5:25
right that you're just asking more,5:29
questions you're curious about the,5:31
conversation at hand if someone came up,5:33
to me and they're like spitting facts,5:36
just non-stop like this is all in for,5:38
information and information overload you,5:40
know you kind of don't even want to,5:43
speak to that person anymore after you,5:44
know a certain amount of time yeah it's,5:47
like they're they're talking at you when,5:49
you start submitting too many facts,5:51
right,5:52
