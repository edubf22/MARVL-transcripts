sentence,startTime
okay so let's dive in so um bring up a,0:00
slide we're gonna start with why we,0:03
should stop touching base checking in,0:05
and what we're gonna stay instead and i,0:08
would like meg if you don't mind i feel,0:10
like you do an awesome job of starting,0:13
this early on in the conversation can,0:15
you tell us a little bit more about that,0:17
absolutely so that's actually the key to,0:18
this whole thing is starting it early on,0:20
in the process so,0:23
when you have that first call with a,0:24
prospect even if it's like super early,0:27
on maybe it's a cold call maybe you're,0:29
in like your first discovery call you've,0:31
got to start early on holding them,0:33
accountable because what it does,0:36
is it puts them in a position where,0:38
they're expecting you,0:40
to actually communicate with them but,0:42
you're expecting something back from,0:44
them so a couple of things that i do,0:47
again early on often and right off the,0:49
bat one of my favorite things to do is,0:51
when i'm sending an email right we send,0:53
emails all day long,0:55
i skip the niceties so,0:57
i don't necessarily put in a lot of,0:59
stuff about like the weather,1:01
or like my sports team,1:03
or whatever,1:05
and and i'm not doing it because i'm,1:06
being mean what i'm doing is doing it,1:08
because i want them to read exactly what,1:09
i want,1:13
where i want it there was some data i,1:14
saw the other day and this is probably a,1:16
little bit older now i bet you the,1:18
prince percentage is even higher but 80,1:19
percent of email is read on a mobile,1:22
device,1:24
so if you're thinking about reading that,1:25
email on a mobile device how many,1:27
scrolls are you going to go through,1:28
right i got one maybe two before i like,1:30
lose track and decide to go to another,1:33
email right so what we want to do is put,1:35
that call to action,1:37
right up front what you're doing is,1:39
conditioning the prospect early on that,1:40
you're going to be direct you're going,1:44
to be upfront not annoying but you're,1:45
going to give them what they want yep i,1:48
agree and i think this could also depend,1:50
on where you are in the sales cycle,1:52
right oh 100,1:54
if you're having a conversation with,1:55
someone and you know them and you've,1:56
already had,1:58
multiple conversations i'm more likely,1:59
to skip the formalities skip the,2:01
niceties maybe if we're new if it's a,2:03
cold message,2:04
add in a little bit sure,2:06
a little bit we can a b split test that,2:09
check it out absolutely i really like,2:11
adrian mentioned in the chat over here,2:13
uh am i being a nuisance yet right and,2:16
getting that response back and saying,2:18
you know,2:21
yeah yes,2:22
even if it is but it's a response yeah,2:23
yeah and i know we don't always,2:25
celebrate right the negative but it's a,2:26
response yeah it's a response and so,2:28
that it's something we're going to talk,2:31
about a little bit more about the idea,2:32
of gauging engagement right so,2:34
our job is to figure out you know are,2:36
these people interested in having,2:38
conversations with us right are they,2:40
interested in actually exchanging a,2:41
dialogue but the way that you do that is,2:43
like getting them on the hook early on,2:46
and letting them know that you are in,2:48
control so one of the things that i am,2:51
just like a huge believer in,2:53
is the fact that like,2:55
you control the sales process the sales,2:57
process does not control you you control,2:59
the prospect the prospect does not,3:01
control you and if you keep that in the,3:03
back of your head you're not going to be,3:05
annoying you're going to be in charge,3:07
you're going to exude confidence and,3:08
when you do that you actually are coming,3:10
across as somebody that is again in,3:13
control has power has authority and,3:15
that's actually what the prospect wants,3:17
at the end of the day right so,3:18
i'm all about keeping it short,3:20
keeping it sweet,3:23
avoiding the you know the nicest that,3:24
doesn't mean that you're you know you,3:26
have to be like this is a really,3:28
annoying thing and please i need you to,3:30
respond right now that's it but you can,3:31
skip the whole like you know,3:33
stuff in the front that we don't need,3:36
how many of you and this isn't a poll so,3:38
i'm rhetorically just asking you all,3:40
this question you can put in the chat,3:42
but yeah how many of you literally start,3:43
your emails with hope you're having a,3:45
great day,3:46
or,3:47
you know,3:48
hope things are going well,3:49
it's not my favorite are you the person,3:53
um,3:55
tell me in the chat like if this is you,3:56
or you know somebody you call them and,3:58
they won't pick up the phone but they'll,4:01
text you back right away yeah or,4:03
you text them and they don't respond but,4:06
they are,4:08
messaging you on instagram,4:09
right exactly like everyone has their,4:12
own way of communication if we're,4:14
walking down this hallway and each of,4:16
our prospects is on a hallway we gotta,4:19
try all the doors right we have to try,4:21
all of them we gotta try email yeah,4:23
email's filled with all these people,4:25
knocking on their ears like email's the,4:28
easiest thing to do you can set them up,4:30
send them out good to go yeah but we got,4:31
to try different things we have to see,4:34
what people like and everyone's,4:35
different what's your favorite way for,4:36
me to get a hold of you video,4:38
video yep so well i mean text me but,4:40
you'd have to have my number i mean you,4:43
do you have to have you have to have a,4:45
proof you have to have approval to text,4:46
me just kidding um,4:48
video is really key for me so and i know,4:52
a lot of you mentioned a couple you,4:55
mentioned your account managers you're,4:56
in cs and so this is something that i,4:57
want to point out directly to you,5:00
video communication to your customer,5:03
base is going to give you such a,5:06
positive result i can't begin to tell,5:08
you at first it's going to feel,5:10
awkward and weird and the same thing,5:12
goes for net new sales too like really,5:14
anyone in the room if you haven't tried,5:16
video before i use video in,5:17
a variety of different things whether,5:20
it's to explain like a particularly long,5:21
email that maybe i need to write out,5:24
with like next steps i'll just do like a,5:26
video short,5:27
um i'll do like from an onboarding,5:29
perspective if i need them to just know,5:31
like two or three different details i'll,5:33
do that like it's a great way to kind of,5:36
get your face literally in front of them,5:38
right,5:42
uh and then also just mix it up and it,5:43
almost gives them permission,5:46
to try something new too which i like,5:48
because it can get,5:50
like,5:52
those doors are scary yeah you know you,5:53
don't know what's coming and it's nice,5:55
to sort of build,5:57
out a little bit of that consistency and,5:58
have that kind of okay i'm gonna try,6:00
video great you're gonna try video,6:02
awesome right,6:05
yeah yeah what is a like quick tip to,6:06
get more comfortable on video maybe some,6:09
practice tips there because it's not,6:12
easy in the beginning we all know that,6:14
yep yep,6:16
so you know and embrace the awkward um i,6:17
tried it out,6:20
a couple years ago at first and i just,6:22
did it with colleagues so i'd send like,6:23
video messages i'd get first and,6:25
foremost just like hold the phone in a,6:26
place that was comfortable then i,6:28
actually invested in like a selfie stick,6:30
and then i invested in a tripod you've,6:32
got a few,6:35
shout outs yeah,6:36
uh and i i did the things that kind of,6:37
made me feel comfortable the biggest,6:40
thing i can tell you is don't overthink,6:42
it don't script it have a conversation,6:44
into the camera get out your points if,6:47
you need to have like a lot of apps have,6:50
like room for notes so if you just need,6:52
to put like a couple of talking points,6:54
do that practice and it's going to be,6:55
great now listen if you do practice and,6:58
you're sending it and you're like god,7:00
that's gross i don't want to ever do,7:03
that again i'm going to challenge you to,7:04
do it again keep trying keep trying it,7:06
um you're going to you got to get over,7:08
the hump you got to get over the initial,7:10
and then once you do that it's awesome,7:13
it truly has changed the way not only,7:15
how i sell but just how i communicate,7:18
with our existing clients your sample,7:20
size like my first sample size i sent,7:21
three videos and i was like nope not,7:23
doing it,7:25
you gotta you have to like really have a,7:26
larger sample size right but i will say,7:28
too for those of you i know there's a,7:30
lot of people chiming in about video and,7:32
we use a variation vidyard um also like,7:34
direct through linkedin messaging if,7:37
you're first degree connected with them,7:39
i would say the other thing to try when,7:41
we're talking about channels,7:43
is,7:45
audio messages,7:46
and,7:48
for me it's performing really similar so,7:49
if you're not comfortable,7:51
like for me it's always like i open my,7:53
phone and i see all of my chins looking,7:54
back and i'm like staring there like my,7:57
phone and i'm like oh no i never want to,7:59
open my phone again my camera just,8:00
looked at me so if you like flip your,8:02
phone around if you want to try video or,8:04
go audio message yeah audio message it's,8:06
um it's performing at the same open and,8:09
response rate for me personally,8:12
and i know that's a little bit different,8:14
for everyone cut you off at 60 seconds,8:16
if you're using linkedin so you're not,8:18
going to go on for too long yeah,8:20
well i try that i actually have not been,8:23
using audio as much does anyone audio,8:24
text with their family or their friends,8:27
um just like on and text message i know,8:30
is a little bit different but you can,8:32
send a linkedin audio voice note as well,8:33
my little sister does that in our,8:36
siblings text she touched she she's a,8:37
big i don't think she's watching this,8:40
but if she had if she was i love your,8:41
audio text thank you,8:44
i think it's it's different and that's a,8:46
big piece of it is just showing up,8:48
different than everyone else who's in,8:51
there right,8:53
it's just such it's an overpopulated,8:54
space right now and,8:56
you know that certainly depends on the,8:58
industry that you're selling in to and,8:59
the industry that you're coming from if,9:01
you're selling in a sas space right now,9:03
to a private equity backed firm you are,9:05
in a very tight marketplace at this,9:07
moment in time so you've got to come up,9:10
with ways to differentiate yourself and,9:12
to stand out and to provide value i,9:14
think the biggest thing,9:16
is having some sort of,9:18
plan some sort of approach and a lot of,9:21
people do but typically that consists of,9:24
the two channels so let's vary it up,9:26
also most people give up,9:29
too early on there's crazy statistics,9:31
that a lot of us are giving up reaching,9:35
out to a specific organization,9:37
or prospect of ours after,9:39
two three four five touches because we,9:42
run out of things to say,9:45
being able to come up with something,9:47
different every time,9:48
are you interested in this no well how,9:50
about that no okay well how about this,9:52
right so we're coming back with,9:54
something different every time and we're,9:55
trying those different doors in the,9:57
hallway different channels seeing how,9:58
they personally want to be communicated,10:01
with i think also just really being,10:03
familiar with who's the best fit for,10:06
your organization yeah who's the best,10:08
fit,10:10
and and that could be different for my,10:11
organization than it is for me,10:13
personally i know i love prospecting,10:14
into people in engagement and your,10:17
favorite is i love like the talent,10:20
acquisition space industry,10:22
like people management software that,10:25
kind of thing for me those are my peeps,10:27
yeah so just like knowing where people,10:28
you find favor with looking at your past,10:31
wins and seeing if there's some sort of,10:34
pattern that emerges that really helps i,10:36
think,10:39
i know we're coming back to the question,10:41
here i went on a wild ride but coming,10:43
back to your question when we're,10:45
thinking about being persistent there,10:47
let them know,10:48
at the end of your sequence or cadence,10:50
whatever you're doing just be like hey,10:52
it looks like this isn't a priority for,10:54
you right now no biggie,10:56
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna let you be i know,10:58
a few people mentioned humor in the chat,11:00
here um i'm gonna let you be for a,11:02
little bit but i'll be back in three,11:04
months or,11:06
i'll be back in a couple months and see,11:07
if it's a better time for you right even,11:09
if they've never responded you're,11:10
managing their expectations right yeah,11:12
look at that full circle there i know,11:14
that was amazing i'm a big fan of one,11:16
word update question mark um,11:18
uh,11:20
next steps um question mark,11:22
feedback,11:25
question mark um,11:26
i've been known to want to send other,11:29
things and subject lines that probably,11:31
are not appropriate,11:32
yeah um,11:34
but those were the ones that come to,11:35
mind yeah those are great i don't use,11:37
checking in following up,11:39
that's not true i will use following up,11:41
if it's truly i actually don't use,11:42
following up i do follow up like this is,11:44
the follow-up email,11:47
but i only do that if i'm literally,11:49
sending,11:51
a follow-up email from a big call,11:52
otherwise if it's something else i use,11:54
update,11:56
that kind of thing yep recap on our,11:57
conversation yep um i like that and,11:58
that's me again,12:01
what about dropping emojis in that,12:03
subject line i just saw that in the chat,12:05
i,12:07
i think this varies and it's like,12:08
personal comfort level,12:09
i see some people do phenomenal with,12:11
this,12:13
and it stands out in an,12:14
a business email inbox you have a ton of,12:17
them in your gmail account or a yahoo,12:19
hotmail i don't know where people where,12:22
people at these days but you have a lot,12:25
of them in your personal account but not,12:27
so much in business i see i think,12:28
there's probably like a work appropriate,12:30
emoji list somewhere like what can be,12:32
used i don't feel comfortable with it,12:34
but i do love symbols so the straight,12:36
line down or like a slider,12:38
yeah yeah greater than less than right,12:42
that's what i was going for um plus i i,12:44
think it just stands out a little bit,12:46
different pattern interrupt yeah yeah,12:48
yeah absolutely i'm not a huge,12:50
emoji,12:53
symbols over emojis for you 100 symbols,12:54
over emojis,12:57
