sentence,startTime
let's kick this off i want to talk about,0:00
hooks,0:01
hooks have a special meaning gb when you,0:02
think about the word hooks what do you,0:05
think of,0:06
all right so i mean there's like,0:07
i just think about like how do you catch,0:10
someone like how do you capture their,0:11
attention like long enough for them to,0:13
go like what is this right so if you,0:16
think about somebody scrolling through,0:18
their email or their look the first,0:20
thing they might be doing in the morning,0:22
or after a meeting is they're looking at,0:23
their phone,0:25
like they have the option to keep on,0:26
moving but there's going to be something,0:28
that hooks their attention where they,0:29
just have to stop right and check it out,0:30
that to me is what a hook is,0:33
it's a choice to stay with the message,0:35
well the i well,0:39
me being super annoying it's like it's,0:40
that mechanism that drives somebody to,0:42
making the choice to check it out so,0:46
like,0:47
i think one of the things that i've,0:48
heard about hooks it's like all right,0:49
maybe you're scrolling through your tick,0:51
tock or an instagram reel or something,0:52
and someone goes stop right you go what,0:54
you know like so just that stop like the,0:57
fact that you stopped like that to me is,0:59
the hook or if it's like hey if you are,1:01
struggling with answering this objection,1:04
and you're like hell yeah yeah you're,1:06
right like it's that thing that goes,1:08
like this is for me,1:10
i think the preview is part of that and,1:12
we're going to talk about that later but,1:14
one of the things that i know to be true,1:15
is that before you send a single email,1:18
you got to know your icp,1:20
you got to know the people that you're,1:22
going to talk to why are you talking to,1:24
them why are they the person that's best,1:26
for this conversation i'm gonna put,1:28
something in the chat right now this is,1:30
a link to zoom info you can go start,1:32
building a list of your ideal clients,1:34
and set the parameters now because,1:36
before you send a single email you got,1:39
to know why you're sending it and who,1:40
you're sending it to this is an,1:42
extremely crucial first step in all of,1:43
sales how often is this a problem in,1:46
your world gb,1:48
um it's different than not yeah yeah,1:50
yeah yeah my bad sorry i got honestly i,1:53
saw that you were wearing a chicago hat,1:55
and i'm like thank you because that's my,1:56
hometown i got distracted a little bit,1:58
there yeah we're going to be in chicago,2:00
this week i leave tomorrow if you're in,2:01
chicago hit me up we're going to throw a,2:02
party on thursday more social than sas,2:04
what let's go let's go let's go but no,2:05
yeah i i can't say like anything but a,2:08
hundred percent it's like um i think,2:10
it's uh uh sam oh it's going to bother,2:12
me that i can't remember her name off,2:14
the top of my head right now but sam,2:15
sales right yeah mckenna sam mccann,2:17
thank you thank you but it's like she's,2:19
like show me you know me right so like,2:20
if you can show someone that you've done,2:23
your research that you've taken the time,2:25
to pull something out that like only,2:27
they,2:29
like that's only gonna be relevant to,2:30
them or only they have written they're,2:32
gonna some people reward you for that,2:33
even if you don't have a solution or a,2:35
platform or service that's super helpful,2:37
for them the fact that you've taken the,2:39
time to go all right i've i've looked at,2:40
your profile i've done some research on,2:43
your company i'm seeing some of the,2:45
initiatives that your company is focused,2:47
on and how your role might be involved,2:49
in this someone might go damn,2:50
yeah,2:54
show me you know me was the first the,2:55
first time i heard that was from sam,2:57
mckenna and i think it was at the,2:58
rainmaker conference in like 2016 2017,3:00
but that really resonated well with the,3:04
crowd i remember them thinking like,3:06
that's the stuff that gets my attention,3:07
and we'll talk about this more as we,3:09
move forward but like when somebody,3:10
starts an email off with,3:12
james that webinar you did yesterday was,3:14
amazing or james that piece of content,3:16
that you put out changed my life yep,3:19
those people get my attention right away,3:21
right i will ignore other emails to open,3:24
that one,3:27
yeah 100,3:28
i think brody brody hill had asked a,3:29
question of like what's the best way to,3:31
find something the prospect or the org,3:33
has said like linkedin the website,3:35
all of it right so one of the things,3:37
that you can do is look at like,3:40
self-authored content and by the way,3:41
like a really helpful resource go check,3:43
out beck hollands flip the script uh uh,3:45
check check out her website and go under,3:47
written content and there's like an,3:49
encyclopedia of like hooks basically and,3:51
it's just telling you like here are all,3:54
the things that are all it's an,3:55
encyclopedia personalization and,3:57
relevant and so you can look at,3:59
something that if they're writing,4:00
content on linkedin like for to james's,4:01
point like for me i put a lot of content,4:03
out there on linkedin if someone goes,4:05
hey i read your post yesterday i take a,4:07
lot of pride in that so like the fact,4:09
that you're taking the time to go and,4:11
associate with something that i take,4:12
pride in i'm going to pay attention to,4:14
it other things that you can look at are,4:16
going to be a company's website of,4:17
course you can go if you're working,4:19
strategic or public accounts you can go,4:20
look at their 10ks you can read,4:22
press releases you can check out are,4:25
they launching new products right you,4:26
can see like what is the company page,4:28
actually posting are they hiring for,4:30
certain positions so like if you you can,4:32
simply go like company name,4:34
plus like strategy 2022 plus the ceo's,4:36
name and you're going to hear about all,4:41
the things that are going to be top of,4:42
mind for that company,4:44
yeah i one if i started to catch myself,4:45
getting bored with what i was saying i,4:48
was like this is too long like that's,4:49
one thing i think secondly as well is,4:51
i,4:53
if it's not conversational it's probably,4:54
not relevance,4:57
so and and then also yeah so i think,4:59
those were really the two big things was,5:01
just like all right if i'm saying this,5:03
out loud and it doesn't flow it doesn't,5:04
sound like a good conversation it,5:06
doesn't say like it doesn't sound like,5:07
me then it's not it's not going to,5:09
resonate with somebody else,5:10
um,5:12
yeah i also feel like when you read it,5:13
out loud you're asking yourself do i,5:15
talk like this,5:17
is this how i sound yeah that's the,5:19
well yeah i i feel like i run into,5:23
situations where like i let's say,5:24
previously,5:27
i wrote like how my manager wrote and,5:28
then i would say it out loud and so then,5:31
there'd just be this huge disconnect um,5:33
and i i'm a big believer in like,5:35
whatever you put out energy-wise is what,5:38
you're going to get back energy-wise so,5:40
if your energy is like i'm just trying,5:42
to sound like somebody else like you're,5:44
not going to get anybody else's,5:45
attention,5:46
so if you feel comfortable you feel,5:47
confident like you're having a good time,5:49
your prospects will too,5:51
yeah absolutely and do that if you're,5:54
not being yourself,5:55
yeah absolutely the energy has to come,5:57
across in the email even though the tone,5:59
is lost that's energy and tone are the,6:01
same but they work well together it's,6:04
important that your tone is upbeat fun,6:07
uplifting and then also it's it's always,6:10
good to have that,6:12
that personalization that adds to the,6:13
flavor of like hey i actually care right,6:15
yeah i'm putting that vibe out there,6:18
that i took the time and i did this uh i,6:20
have some emails that i can share with,6:22
you lisa uh or liz foster great question,6:24
there and i think gb was digging through,6:27
her inbox to look at some as well so,6:29
we'll get to that here in a second but,6:31
let's talk some of that about some of,6:33
this let me know if you find one you,6:34
want to share right away,6:35
uh gb i'm i'm fine with that right,6:37
i want to talk about this second to last,6:39
one because i think the second to last,6:41
one is a little bit controversial we,6:42
have about 20 minutes left so i want to,6:43
get to this one for sure remove the,6:45
informative tone,6:47
i think this is interesting because we,6:49
find lavender reports back will will,6:51
will state,6:53
that when you lose the informative tone,6:54
you actually get a higher reply rate but,6:57
all of our leadership teaches us that we,7:00
should be educating our prospects where,7:02
do we draw the line,7:04
oh good question,7:08
right so i guess i'm i'm curious about,7:10
the informative tone right like what,7:12
does that look like what does that sound,7:15
like,7:16
to me i think it sounds like did you,7:17
knows i think it sounds like hey here's,7:18
a great article that i thought would be,7:21
relevant to you uh and you know maybe,7:23
the article is great maybe you're even,7:25
pointing to that special place where,7:27
they should be looking in the article to,7:28
get that value but in the end you're,7:30
still quote educating your prospect,7:32
you're still sharing that knowledge but,7:34
then we know based on lavender's data,7:36
that if you shorten that email and lose,7:38
that informative tone that educational,7:41
tone you actually get a higher reply,7:44
rate so where do we draw the line what's,7:45
a good tactic to start thinking about,7:47
this this way it's it's definitely an,7:49
interesting conversation and feel free,7:51
to jump in in the chat and say your your,7:52
piece on this y'all yes i'm trying to,7:54
think i've seen it where like okay like,7:56
we have a gartner like let's say gartner,7:58
publishes a report and they say hey like,8:00
this percentage of,8:02
this,8:04
like,8:05
uh,8:05
uh cxo right,8:06
um so it's like 73 of cmos really care,8:08
about operational execution right like,8:11
if i start off my email like that i'm,8:13
like this is marketing this is marketing,8:15
spiel right like right it has nothing to,8:17
do with me and then also i think it's,8:19
coming across like yeah i know like i,8:20
know operational execute like i know,8:22
that operational efficiencies are,8:24
important get out of my face right but,8:25
if it's something along the lines of,8:28
like hey,8:29
see that you have uh or like you know,8:30
you you did a little bit of research and,8:32
it's like,8:34
um i always like the question even of,8:35
like hey with,8:37
if your company's has this huge like,8:39
change transfer like this digital,8:40
transformation process in place knowing,8:42
that like you know,8:44
three out of four every change,8:46
management projects fail how are you,8:47
setting your team up,8:49
to like be one of the like one of those,8:50
four who doesn't,8:53
so i'm like i'm not beating people over,8:55
the head with a bunch of information i'm,8:56
just kind of calling out like you're,8:58
doing x y and z most of the time it's,9:00
it's it's a bust like what like how are,9:02
you and your team making sure that,9:04
you're not part of that,9:05
all right so we talked about tonality,9:07
and we talked about the way that we,9:09
write uh happy tone informative tone and,9:10
a tentative tone can you break these,9:13
down for us,9:14
ooh happy tone okay so like,9:16
i feel like some people will start off,9:20
an email with all doom and gloom right,9:21
like,9:23
everything is messed up it's terrible,9:24
the world is burning the world is,9:26
burning right like i i or like or it's,9:28
just really really drab and so i think,9:31
finding ways of like or it doesn't have,9:33
to be like oh like smiley faces and,9:36
things like that yeah but,9:37
um,9:39
that's kind of like how i think about it,9:41
it's just like you don't want to go like,9:42
hey everything is messed up everything,9:43
is screwed and nothing is ever going to,9:44
be the same unless you have us it's just,9:46
more so like hey here's some things that,9:48
i'm seeing that like that i really agree,9:50
with that i think are super exciting or,9:52
that i'm super interested in like i,9:54
think there's that kind of tone to your,9:55
emails and then someone had asked this,9:57
question of like within the chat of hey,9:59
like is it if i'm if i'm referencing an,10:01
article like is that me being,10:03
informative or not if i'm,10:05
if i'm referencing like a,10:08
analyst report that anybody and,10:10
everybody can read and i'm pulling,10:12
quotes from that and i'm trying to like,10:13
go hey like look at this stuff and,10:15
here's the information that i'm going to,10:17
have if i'm just trying to like,10:18
basically just read off a gartner report,10:20
that to me is taking an informative tone,10:22
versus if i'm taking an article and i'm,10:25
saying hey like you were quoted saying x,10:27
y and z that really resonated with me,10:29
and then you ask a question about how,10:32
they're trying to do something that is,10:33
just more so like bringing in relevance,10:35
versus trying to inform someone of,10:37
something that they can go and find out,10:38
themselves for example um,10:40
yeah and so i think even for the tent,10:44
like there was something there um what,10:45
this would have been will's part of like,10:47
the tentative tone,10:48
there's the conversation about like all,10:50
right i'm trying to remember exactly,10:51
what he said like if you come in and,10:53
you're unsure about things like it's,10:54
much more like an inquisitive if that's,10:56
a better thing versus an informative but,10:58
i can't recall exactly what he said,11:00
uh there's i think it's a confidence,11:02
thing number one but then there's this,11:03
competence level too you can't display,11:05
confidence if you're not competent in,11:07
what you're doing so the two feed each,11:09
other really well uh but i know the,11:10
two-piece part was the part that caught,11:13
my attention so for those of you that,11:15
don't know will i think he's said this,11:17
on a few of our shows in the past uh he,11:19
may have even tweeted about it a time or,11:20
two uh you can go follow him on twitter,11:22
there's a lot of value there in,11:24
following him he puts out a lot of great,11:26
content about email writing specifically,11:27
uh but one of the things that he does is,11:29
he does the two piece so a valid reason,11:31
for the personalization or the relevance,11:34
or both right you can be personalized,11:36
and relevant which is like the ultimate,11:38
combo but if i have to choose between,11:39
relevance and personalization i'm going,11:42
to go relevance mostly right that tends,11:43
to have the higher reply and the second,11:46
piece of your two-piece meal is this,11:48
good flow for the message is it a linear,11:50
thought process there's no breaks that,11:52
are hard great example of a break and,11:55
this is a pattern that we see a lot hey,11:56
i see you went to the university of,11:58
maryland john anyway the reason i'm,11:59
reaching out is because i have this ai,12:01
tool right it's broken it's not,12:02
associated it's not affiliated with the,12:04
message it has no bearing on what your,12:06
value proposition is and therefore it is,12:08
meaningless you can personalize with,12:10
useless stuff like that until the cows,12:12
come home it's probably not going to,12:14
impact your open rate your reply rate or,12:16
the number of people that close business,12:18
with you and that's the ultimate goal,12:21
thoughts on that gb i see this all the,12:22
time where people go look at this really,12:25
like look at all this personalization,12:27
that i put in honestly what i think one,12:28
of the things that can plague a team is,12:31
they are more interested about in um and,12:34
their friends and their colleagues like,12:38
cheering them on in their,12:39
personalization than actually getting,12:40
results so it's like hey like i have,12:42
this really like this really witty,12:44
whatever and it's like no like have you,12:46
actually talked about what's going on in,12:47
their business have you actually talked,12:49
about what's going on in their role and,12:50
their responsibilities like in a way,12:51
that garners a response that drives,12:53
pipeline if the answer is no then i'm,12:55
like great like pat yourself on the back,12:57
and like let's do this again so,12:59
you know that's like that i mean that's,13:02
my that's my honest thought and then um,13:03
yeah i mean that's that's really it i,13:06
think we have to make sure that what for,13:08
me if i'm reading something and it goes,13:09
hey gb i saw that you like matcha lattes,13:12
and then all of a sudden we're talking,13:15
about something totally different i'm,13:16
like okay well i'm an sdr manager like,13:17
i'm gonna i appreciate the fact that i,13:19
have no idea what matcha is in your,13:21
solution and then i'm just confused yeah,13:23
right so like help me not be confused,13:25
i'm a simple i've got you know like,13:27
a reptile brain up here like make it,13:30
really simple for me to figure things,13:31
out,13:33
