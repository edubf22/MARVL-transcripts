sentence,startTime
cool what's going on everybody welcome,0:00
I'm so excited for this session by the,0:02
way,0:04
um yeah I have a couple tips on this so,0:05
when I'm doing prep for a discovery call,0:07
one of the big things that I do that I,0:10
think is a little bit different is I'm,0:12
taking notes in the form of questions so,0:14
I'm thinking about what are the,0:17
different triggers for the thing that I,0:18
sell that I want to point out and have a,0:20
conversation with the buyer about and,0:22
what I don't want to do is take notes,0:24
where it's like okay they had an event,0:26
uh their their customer event last month,0:28
and oh this person was on a podcast,0:31
recently where they talked about needing,0:33
better data analytics and I sell a data,0:36
analytics tool what I don't want to be,0:37
doing is being in the heat of Battle of,0:39
that Discovery call and trying to figure,0:41
out okay they talked about Dana,0:44
analytics how am I going to turn that,0:46
into a discovery question I want to do,0:48
all of that prep work up front so I'm,0:50
actually taking prep notes of the,0:52
questions I'm going to ask them I'm not,0:55
going to get to every single question,0:57
but my idea here is I want want to save,0:58
cognitive brain power which I have a,1:01
limited amount of,1:03
um for for better stuff than those,1:04
questions so that's a really big one,1:06
um the other thing that I think about is,1:09
I really want to walk into that meeting,1:11
knowing what's top of mind for that,1:13
customer and so what I'm going to do is,1:15
I want to find recent LinkedIn posts,1:18
that they made a recent podcast that,1:20
they were on if I can find a YouTube,1:22
clip that they did recently my whole,1:23
goal is to figure out like what's top of,1:26
mind for this point and for this person,1:28
and point that out hey I listened to,1:30
your um your your your webinar recording,1:32
on the sell better webinar series and I,1:35
heard you say this even if it's like not,1:38
totally related to my thing I want to,1:40
signal to them that I have done my,1:42
homework because people will reciprocate,1:44
that effort the demonstration of hey I,1:47
did my work folks will say all right,1:50
this person's trying and they'll give,1:51
you way way more than if you go in and,1:53
it's obvious you haven't done your work,1:56
Charles I know you had great point about,1:58
industry can you tell us a little bit,2:01
more about that yeah I love the do we,2:03
have to do research option that is that,2:05
is I love that I love that uh yeah so,2:07
I'm gonna say two things uh one of three,2:12
things one I love Nick sigowski so he's,2:15
got great great insights so thank you,2:17
very much I learned from Nick every,2:18
single time I speak with him the second,2:20
thing I'll say is,2:22
um you know there's we should all be at,2:25
the risk of stating the obvious,2:28
there are we should be paying attention,2:30
to tracking and monitoring industry,2:32
focused research so there's there's,2:36
research on the company that we're about,2:40
to have a conversation with and there's,2:42
research on the people that we're about,2:43
to talk to all very important,2:46
um with that said we should also be,2:49
researching the industry period in,2:52
general,2:56
in between calls that's the type of,2:57
research I'm talking about the,3:00
in-between research uh similar to,3:01
nurturing for prospects but we're,3:04
nurturing our minds for ourselves and so,3:06
um signing up for if it's uh private and,3:10
just giving a a one industry as an,3:13
example,3:16
um if it's the private Equity world or,3:18
landscape or if it's a sector that any,3:21
of you are focused on the health care,3:24
sector I'm going to look at news,3:25
specific journals and sources that only,3:27
talk about health care or that only talk,3:31
about private Equity,3:33
um hopefully if you're selling hopefully,3:35
you're liking what you're selling and if,3:38
you're liking what you're selling you're,3:40
going to like reading about what you're,3:41
selling and so definitely that is a very,3:43
very big part of research because a lot,3:46
of times you'll bring that up in a,3:48
conversation with any company with any,3:50
Prospect oh I just saw this happen in,3:53
the industry I'm also not just in the,3:55
know about you I'm in the know about the,3:58
industry I'm going to know I'm going to,4:00
know about your peers I'm going to know,4:02
about companies in your portfolio and,4:04
then know about the industry that's a,4:07
big part of the research that is,4:09
important for us as account executives,4:10
um and the uh the second thing I wanted,4:14
to add with regard to uh to prep is you,4:17
know what I think I may have put those,4:22
two in one because I totally am blanking,4:24
out oh here it comes here it comes the,4:26
second item the second item is I've,4:28
talked to Nick sugowski about this,4:31
um research is important okay but it's,4:34
important for us as AES or sdrs not to,4:37
overburden ourselves because if we do,4:40
too much and feel like we have to show,4:44
credibility then we end up talking more,4:47
than we would have liked or we just end,4:49
up you know trying to uh prove to our,4:52
Prospect we are credible and we know,4:56
we're all knowing take it easy,4:58
have this is an art as much as it is a,5:01
science know enough to be dangerous so,5:04
don't overburden yourself place a lot of,5:06
the burden on the prospects as well,5:08
that's what I have to say about research,5:09
what we have next we want to know the,5:11
techniques you want to be asking your,5:13
the techniques you you gotta you gotta,5:16
really lean into like the questions you,5:18
got to be asking that lean into your,5:20
solution,5:22
so tell me Charles what do you have,5:23
around this you got any any uh thoughts,5:27
that come into us right away yeah thank,5:29
you Adrian I want to point out a very,5:32
subtle point a very important point we,5:33
are not talking about leading questions,5:36
um that's not what we're talking about,5:41
leading questions are I'm asking you,5:42
this question knowing this Prospect is,5:45
going to answer it in the following way,5:47
that is totally self-serving people,5:49
catch on to that,5:52
um that's not what we're talking about,5:54
we're talking about,5:55
leading with questions that will prime a,5:58
very thoughtful and effective,6:03
conversation so what does that mean in,6:05
English,6:08
that means at the beginning of any,6:08
conversation,6:11
it's always very important we learn that,6:13
context is King okay in sales I think,6:15
John barrows talks a lot about that so,6:19
in the beginning of this of the,6:21
conversation we kind of want to know,6:22
like where where are where are we at,6:24
where are we at so let's assume without,6:27
getting into heavy granularity,6:30
uh me and sagelski hey Nick nice to,6:32
connect uh blah blah blah where you're,6:34
from okay uh I was down till you know,6:37
until 2 30 is that or to three o'clock,6:40
that's time till that time still work,6:42
for you yeah sure and then I might say,6:44
by the way Nick you know just to make,6:47
sure we're we're on the on the same page,6:48
here I was just curious to what extent,6:51
you have familiarity with our,6:53
organization I'm not sure if you've done,6:54
research or what you know if you spoke,6:57
with us in the past Etc now most,6:58
prospects will either say I don't have,7:01
any familiar or any or no I have some,7:04
familiarity but not enough tell me more,7:06
like rarely almost never someone gonna,7:08
be like yeah I know everything about you,7:11
guys okay so why are we talking right oh,7:13
right so then after I get some Center,7:16
like where are they at no you can tell,7:18
me a little bit yeah I don't really know,7:20
everything about you guys then I might,7:22
throw in and ask for permission I love,7:24
asking for permission by the way it's,7:25
very inviting it pulls people in and,7:28
doesn't push people away I might say,7:31
Nick cool so before we kick off the,7:33
conversation here would it be all right,7:35
if I just give you some high level,7:36
context around what we do and maybe a,7:37
little context as to why I reached out,7:40
to you yeah sure great and then I'm,7:41
going to start with something called a,7:45
positioning statement,7:46
um a positioning statement less less,7:48
than 30 seconds and what it is is,7:52
I'm telling my Prospect what we do in,7:55
less than 30 seconds but I'm not telling,7:59
them what we do I'm really telling them,8:02
why people talk to us right on sales a,8:04
lot of us get like uh stuck on oh we are,8:07
uh we're a platform we're a tool we're,8:12
we're this like no one cares what you,8:15
it's like I'm a human being okay like,8:17
we'll get to that right they're very,8:19
stuck on what we are and they're very,8:21
stuck on how we do things,8:24
right and those two oh this is how we do,8:27
no one cares about how you do things or,8:30
what you are,8:33
without,8:34
being interested in what problems people,8:36
talk to you about oh that's interesting,8:39
then if I know that like oh so what do,8:41
you guys do,8:44
how do you do that right that comes much,8:45
later so the positioning statement might,8:46
sound like great so so Nick just to give,8:49
you some,8:51
some some quick context what we do is,8:52
really simple I'll talk about CB,8:54
insights for a second uh our clients,8:57
come to us really to talk about three,9:00
main topics one,9:02
getting better coverage in a certain,9:05
industry even if that's a spec even if,9:06
they're specialists in that area because,9:09
many times they can miss out on a,9:11
relevant company that could have been,9:12
really impactful for them they talk to,9:14
us a lot about that a lot of our clients,9:16
want to understand,9:18
how they can better,9:19
be more accurate how could they get how,9:23
they could be more accurate when it,9:25
comes to data because they find,9:26
themselves spending a lot of time on,9:27
data that actually wasn't accurate which,9:29
has incorrectly affected their strategy,9:31
and the third topic people like to talk,9:34
about with us is just to understand what,9:36
trends are happening within certain,9:39
emerging technology that they had no,9:41
idea about that could really be a,9:43
benefit for their organization when it,9:45
comes to inorganic growth so those are,9:47
some three topics that people want to,9:49
talk to us about which we help solve for,9:51
I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions,9:53
on that which I'm happy to answer with,9:55
that said it seems that now I'm in,9:58
transitioning totally it seems that you,10:00
do this my guess is that you track,10:02
emerging technology companies which is,10:04
the reason why I had reached out to in,10:06
the first place based on my research I,10:08
saw you guys came up with a new product,10:10
line or a new initiative and my,10:12
hypothesis was that hey this is,10:14
something that you're doing already,10:16
correct me if I'm wrong and B to the,10:17
extent that you are doing it I'd love to,10:19
understand how that works how you think,10:22
about it and then we can take it from,10:23
there if that works for you so it's like,10:25
my positioning statement right,10:27
immediately transitioning into talking,10:28
about them not never saying a word about,10:31
who we are never saying a word about,10:33
what we do all I said was why people,10:35
talk to us in the first place and now my,10:37
immediate question is focused on them,10:39
while I've already primed thoughtfully,10:42
the conversation around hopefully our,10:45
solution in order to avoid them telling,10:48
me Oh this is our company we were 20,10:51
years old and we've all we've all,10:55
experienced all of us and we all will,10:57
continue to experience as AES and sdrs,10:59
Prospects who just talk about nothing,11:02
nothing for 15 20 minutes you're sitting,11:04
on the phone like what am I doing it is,11:07
our responsibility to prime the pump so,11:09
that's how I would start a conversation,11:10
like that now I know one thing that has,11:12
to do with intention is you also want to,11:15
avoid certain questions and I want to,11:17
know from everyone in the audience we,11:20
have a poll for you guys here do you,11:22
guys avoid any type of questions in your,11:24
Discovery you know you just gotta fire,11:28
away with no regard or do you actually,11:30
just be like I don't want to ask this,11:32
could be touchy I know we mentioned we,11:34
want to be sure about that that why word,11:37
why is that Nick did you have something,11:40
to touch on that well you're gonna ask,11:42
me why is that uh yeah so the word the,11:44
word why is a double-edged sword,11:48
it can be your best friend in a sales,11:52
conversation and it can also be your,11:55
worst enemy in a sales conversation,11:58
the word why,12:01
asks the other person to defend their,12:04
position on what that question is about,12:09
so if I say to Charles Charles why are,12:12
you using a virtual background today,12:14
well now Charles has to Charles has to,12:17
justify why he's using a virtual,12:19
background today which there's nothing,12:22
wrong with I think your background looks,12:23
really nice today Charles,12:24
if I ask the customer about their,12:26
current stay I say you know why are you,12:30
doing things like that today you know,12:32
they're telling me Oh they have to,12:34
defend that that statement so if any,12:36
time you're using the word why you don't,12:38
want to put the person on the defensive,12:40
the one time you want to have somebody,12:43
defend something is when they're,12:45
justifying why they're looking into your,12:46
thing so,12:49
if they're telling me Oh Our systems you,12:51
know I was selling Law Firm time,12:53
tracking software for a while and if,12:55
they told me oh you know the lawyers are,12:56
frustrated and we're not efficient,12:58
enough and things are really manual and,12:59
I say well why are you using the system,13:01
well now they're going to defend the,13:03
choice to use that system in the first,13:05
place well the managing partner said we,13:06
had to get this and he used it before,13:08
and well now they're just justifying the,13:10
reason that they bought that system that,13:11
they had originally said they were,13:13
trying to change in the first place well,13:14
that's not good instead I want to say,13:16
well you know gosh usually when I talk,13:19
to law firms and they're telling me,13:22
about their time tracking software,13:23
sometimes lawyers are really wedded to,13:25
that stuff and making a change is a,13:27
pretty big deal I guess,13:29
why even have a conversation with a firm,13:31
like ours about making this sort of,13:33
change that question now they have to,13:35
defend their reason for wanting to make,13:37
a change and when you get somebody to,13:40
defend their reason for wanting to make,13:42
a change things often go in your way,13:44
because now you understand their true,13:46
motivations so you got to be careful,13:48
with why you don't want them to defend,13:50
the wrong thing,13:52
uh amazing Insight Nick in terms of,13:54
avoiding uh defending the wrong thing,13:57
what's interesting about the word the,14:00
word why is,14:03
um a lesser known insight about the word,14:06
why is why the word y can be a grand,14:08
slam home run,14:13
if you ask the prospect,14:15
why they think,14:19
that something is the case or why they,14:23
feel that's the case that's just a,14:25
genius question it can't go wrong so I'm,14:28
going to botch what Nick said but if if,14:30
a prospect was like yeah we're working,14:32
with all these systems and it's really,14:34
inefficient and it's really,14:36
um you know frustrating people and we're,14:38
having a hard time with it and I say,14:41
that's interesting why do you feel,14:42
that's the case or that's really why do,14:44
you think that's why do you think that's,14:46
happening,14:48
that's it and sometimes they'll be like,14:48
I don't know,14:52
you know okay you know what why do you,14:53
feel that even by the way even if you're,14:56
having a conversation just about about,14:57
the industry,14:59
that has nothing to do with them they,15:00
might want to talk to you about oh yeah,15:02
we just saw these this company come come,15:03
out with a product line you know where,15:06
where a fan you know where we that's,15:08
something that we want to do and I might,15:10
be like,15:11
you know what why do you like their what,15:12
or this might be like what do you like,15:15
about their initiative about maybe like,15:17
why do you feel like that's something,15:18
you've been falling behind on,15:20
you know why do you feel or why do you,15:23
think and then finish that sentence is a,15:25
slant on against the emotional heart of,15:27
the conversation,15:29
um so that's just to tag on to what Nick,15:31
was saying the other thing about like a,15:32
lot of times people ask me like Charles,15:34
what are some questions I would never,15:36
ask and this is my philosophy on,15:37
questions,15:40
I don't believe there's such a thing as,15:42
a bad question objectively in isolation,15:45
Okay I do think there is such a thing as,15:49
a bad way to ask a question because if,15:52
you know how to ask questions in,15:55
Discovery you can ask any question you,15:57
want and none of them will be bad it's,15:59
bad if the delivery is bad right if the,16:02
way that Nick talked about why right why,16:06
is your background blurry right there's,16:08
there's a way that's a bad question but,16:10
he can ask it in a better way and so,16:12
there are always better ways to ask any,16:14
questions that we want to ask part of,16:16
the list that's on the on the slide is,16:18
um you know not asking sometimes AES or,16:22
scrs will ask questions this is a big,16:24
usually it's more of the newer the newer,16:26
folks they ask questions that they don't,16:29
understand the question,16:31
it's like that's a very high level,16:32
question that some people ask here to be,16:34
inside you know can you help me,16:36
understand Bob what your deliverable is,16:37
as a team and I'm walking through a a,16:39
call I'm having a session with an AE I'm,16:42
like what does that mean what does that,16:44
mean you're deliverable,16:45
and he's like I don't really know,16:47
so I'm like why would you ask a question,16:50
that you don't know what it means,16:51
because then the prospect is going to do,16:53
one of two things they're going to say,16:56
well what does that mean and you're like,16:58
oh crap right or the prospect's not,16:59
going to give you a good answer and,17:02
you're like oh cool great we,17:05
accomplished nothing in the past three,17:06
minutes I'm gonna move to the next one,17:07
understand with the meaning of your,17:09
question and always understand why,17:12
you're asking it because if the prospect,17:14
doesn't understand why I wish they,17:16
shouldn't based on what we just talked,17:18
about giving reasons for questions you,17:19
know why you're asking it,17:21
