sentence,startTime
using voicemail in a different way this,0:00
is something that i think we should all,0:02
talk about because voicemail is not the,0:04
same as it once was so how do we use,0:06
voicemail differently,0:08
yeah i mean so i think back in the day,0:11
when you're making a cold call you might,0:14
expect someone to actually you know uh,0:16
respond and actually call you back you,0:18
might say something like hey james this,0:20
is tom calling from gong you know think,0:21
you might be a good fit for what we're,0:23
selling based on abc you know here's my,0:24
number you say your number two times you,0:27
say hey call me back whenever you have a,0:29
second i don't know about you all but,0:30
i've gotten in you know seven or eight,0:32
years of sales i've probably gotten one,0:34
or two callbacks ever uh it's very rare,0:36
you might get it if you're lucky but,0:38
it's not something that you should bank,0:40
on so the way that i try to do that is,0:41
as a as a touch point to bring them to a,0:43
different channel that i'm more likely,0:45
to get a response i'm more likely to get,0:47
them to respond uh to my email or,0:49
respond to a linkedin message or some,0:52
other channel that i'm hitting them up,0:54
so i might say something like you know,0:55
hey james this is tom from gong uh,0:57
totally don't need to call me back i,1:00
actually just shot you an email uh the,1:02
subject line is you know something to do,1:04
with jb sales uh look forward to,1:06
catching up with you there or hey james,1:08
i didn't catch you here i'm actually,1:10
going to call you back at 2 p.m eastern,1:12
time hope that works for you hope to,1:14
catch it and have a conversation and so,1:15
you're using voicemail as a way to get,1:17
them to respond in a different channel,1:20
rather than just crossing your fingers,1:21
hoping they call you back,1:23
the reason why i like that is because,1:25
most emails follow or most voicemails,1:28
follow a very specific formula hi this,1:30
is me i'm calling from x we do this,1:32
thing because we're trying to sell,1:35
somebody that's not even there,1:36
and then call me back which never,1:38
happens right that's like the standard,1:40
flow but in this instance you're taking,1:42
and you're throwing that all in the,1:44
trash and you're saying,1:45
take this other action go find me at,1:47
this place go do this other thing i,1:49
really like,1:52
that assignment if you i find that,1:53
people like little assignments if you,1:54
send them you know hey do this thing it,1:56
will help you do do this right or hey do,1:58
this thing because i'm going to keep,2:00
coming at you right like that i feel,2:02
like that is that's a money strategy,2:05
right there so i really like that any,2:06
thoughts on using voicemail differently,2:08
between the two of you sam landon yeah i,2:09
i love it i use a dialer here at notes,2:13
we got we got a dialer so i use,2:15
voicemail drops,2:16
that way i can just keep going through,2:18
but make sure it's relevant to whoever,2:20
i'm calling and um,2:22
yeah similar to like tom's like when i,2:24
when i call my prospects like i'm,2:26
calling them in the morning after they,2:28
open my email but i'm also hitting them,2:29
later in the day and on that second call,2:31
that's when i'll leave the voicemail so,2:33
i want two attempts a day to get them,2:35
maybe at a different time to see if i,2:37
can increase the the the pickup rates,2:39
here's here's my scoop so for for you,2:41
any of you who have followed me before,2:44
you'll know that i don't believe in cold,2:45
calls which is why i'm being a little,2:47
mute on the idea of cold calls and,2:48
that's okay you can hate on me in the,2:50
chat go for it but here's my here's my,2:51
thought if you have to make them if you,2:53
believe in them if you love them if you,2:54
love making them whatever um here's my,2:56
thought so use use cold calls with a,2:58
different intention and the intention is,3:01
not to hustle the person to speak to,3:02
right now i am originally from,3:04
switzerland i went to swiss finishing,3:05
school i believe manners first i hate,3:07
cold calls cause i think they're rude,3:09
right just think about who just called,3:11
james it was probably a cool call,3:12
interrupting his day without his,3:14
permission to self-servingly close a,3:15
deal so here's what i say just call,3:17
inside and say james i am almost certain,3:19
i am calling you at a bad time uh you,3:21
might my name might look familiar as i,3:23
see that you've opened my emails insert,3:24
landon's play um i would love to find,3:26
somebody to talk to you about how sam,3:28
sales can help you guys if you've got,3:29
some time to chat i'd love to love to,3:31
schedule that do you have some time over,3:33
the next week or two wait grab some time,3:34
it's different right we talk about being,3:36
different all the time and it's,3:38
different people are going to be like,3:39
what instead of like james hello do you,3:40
have 36 seconds for me to tell you why i,3:42
called today no 19.3,3:43
goodbye or even sorry you guys for for,3:47
the cool calls that are like hey this is,3:49
a cool call do you want to hang up or,3:51
roll the dice i want to hang up take,3:52
care,3:54
just,3:55
bring some manners into it right it,3:56
doesn't have to be right now let them,3:58
pick a time and then hope that they show,4:00
i will also say cold calls have,4:02
historically the lowest show rates so,4:04
for all of you who are like they're,4:05
never gonna show if i schedule next time,4:06
you've gotta fish on the line talk to,4:08
them who gives a um,4:09
just schedule it for another time i,4:12
guarantee you'll be better off build a,4:14
better relationship and they might,4:15
invite other people to the call and then,4:16
you're multi-threading out of the gate,4:18
hello i want i wanna i wanna i wanna be,4:20
the opposite person i wanna tell you,4:22
that if and i'm gonna put it in writing,4:24
to be fair i love a good cold call i,4:25
will take your cold call i will talk to,4:27
you about it and then i will tell you,4:29
how bad your pitch is that is what i do,4:31
right and it's not it's not a hateful,4:34
thing it's just that you should probably,4:36
hear it right somebody has to tell you,4:38
someone has to tell you you're making,4:40
exactly this is not relevant to me and,4:41
you don't know anything about me but,4:44
thank you so much for the call,4:46
right at least if they call me back i,4:48
can assume maybe they did a little bit,4:49
more research and then called me back,4:51
and they were like yo,4:52
i just checked out who you are and let,4:54
me tell you something that's actually,4:56
relevant to you i hope that happens one,4:57
day but it hasn't happened yet um i,4:59
think brevity is is key right i think,5:00
for me i'm rarely if ever using a,5:02
subject line that's more than three,5:05
words um and you want to pass kind of,5:07
like an internal filter people have of,5:09
is this a sales person emailing me so uh,5:11
a salesy subject line might be,5:14
how to boost your win rates by you know,5:17
100 with gong,5:20
you know delete trash they're never,5:21
going to open that email um but if you,5:23
if you say if the subject line is is,5:26
kind of vague and sounds like something,5:28
maybe a co-worker might have sent or a,5:30
boss might have sent um you know like i,5:32
might say like you know your sales,5:34
strategy right i use you and your as the,5:36
first word in a lot of subject lines um,5:39
and so i think you want to mix it up i,5:41
think you want to make it sound,5:43
compelling but casual certainly not,5:44
salesy or spammy,5:47
and i've always found that the less,5:48
words the better and let's get just,5:50
straight into the email and you don't,5:52
want to give them a reason to hit delete,5:54
you know you want to at least attract,5:57
some sort of like uh of interest for,5:58
them to actually click through to it,6:01
yeah so this this has to be show me you,6:03
know me leads through every single part,6:04
of our sales cycle right whether we're,6:06
it's the very first email or we've been,6:08
working with somebody for 10 years but,6:09
show me your nobi to me is not only the,6:10
relevance and personalization of who,6:12
they are but also thinking about the,6:14
company the vertical what you know about,6:15
them so we do show me you know me,6:17
especially the higher that we go in the,6:19
chain right i saw someone say that you,6:20
know emails aren't getting through to,6:22
anybody emails are getting through to,6:23
your senior executives if you are,6:25
looking for senior executives or in,6:26
higher end smb mid-market commercial,6:28
enterprise think about email and think,6:30
about how to stand out todd capone has a,6:32
really good book called the transparency,6:34
sale and in that he shows a screenshot,6:36
of what his inbox looked like when he,6:37
was a cro 20 to 25 emails a day it is,6:39
the same thing in my inbox all day every,6:42
day and it is the same generic subject,6:44
line so think about again that idea of,6:46
being different how can we be different,6:48
so do some show me you know me if you,6:51
reach out to me we've got 900 people on,6:52
the call today if you reach out to me,6:55
and you send something that says like,6:58
nickelodeon plus you know orlando plus,6:59
linkedin plus barefoot contessa plus,7:02
anything that you can find on my,7:04
linkedin profile i will respond to your,7:06
email,7:08
i'm wondering how many of you guys will,7:09
reach out with that show may know me but,7:11
it's different it shows you've done your,7:12
homework we're asking people for 15 20,7:14
minutes and then somehow still always,7:16
then a 30-minute calendar invite i do,7:17
not know why but we're asking them for,7:19
that just show that you've done five or,7:20
ten minutes of your homework yes it,7:23
takes time quality over quantity here i,7:24
promise you if you do that,7:27
personalization someone will at least,7:29
open your email which is the toughest,7:31
thing to do in the first place and then,7:33
tie some value together with that right,7:36
james said i used in south florida i,7:37
grew up in florida now i can tie that,7:39
together i can talk about that i know,7:41
the gym goes to the the gym because i,7:42
can see them on instagram doing that i,7:44
can tie that together and i can say but,7:45
you talk about them forever the real,7:47
reason for my outreach is this you as,7:48
this specific title have this specific,7:50
challenge i assume because the people,7:52
that we work with in your same time,7:53
don't have that challenge here's a,7:54
specific way that we can solve that for,7:56
you and that's the relevancy right,7:57
relevancy isn't about the,7:59
personalization so to speak it's about,8:01
the personalization to that buyer,8:02
persona i know what your challenges are,8:04
i suspect that you have the same,8:06
challenges that these buyer personas,8:07
have that we work with here's a specific,8:09
way we can solve that how does that,8:11
sound there's much more to it than that,8:12
but that's a start,8:14
all right you guys so um breakdown of a,8:15
cold email and this is something that we,8:18
use day in and day out you might be,8:19
looking at something like oh my god it's,8:20
so long here's the thing to think about,8:22
so you're covering a couple things one,8:23
shout out to gong great partner of us,8:25
love them if you don't have it in your,8:27
toms territory give them a shout um,8:29
here's the thing now gong talks about,8:31
how longer emails work versus shorter,8:32
emails the long email again has to be,8:35
personal relevant and intentional so,8:37
check that out this breakdown this is,8:39
what we teach all day every day number,8:41
one subject line show me you know me it,8:43
thinks about so a former fa this is a,8:45
flight attendant somebody on our team,8:47
was a flight attendant reached out to a,8:48
former flight attendant what a great way,8:50
to connect now the other thing think,8:51
about taking away the salesy subject,8:53
line or the salesy first sentence we do,8:55
not want to have something in here that,8:57
says i hope this means you will happy,8:58
monday there are no happy mondays right,9:00
cut that out right now happy friday is,9:01
the only thing that exists take out,9:03
anything that says sales and subject,9:05
lines sales in the first sentence right,9:06
all of that stuff looks the same be,9:08
different we keep talking about that now,9:10
next we want to make sure that we tie,9:12
the show me you know me right so talk,9:14
about the flight attendant piece you,9:16
know relate a story back to that connect,9:17
with that person as a shocking human,9:19
right awesome opportunity just make that,9:21
connection and then to say again the,9:24
reason for my initial outreach is xyz,9:25
what you want to think about next the,9:27
biggest mistake that i see every single,9:29
company make when we rewrite their,9:31
sequences and we dive in is that they,9:32
focus on the 30 000 foot level of what,9:34
they do instead of one specific thing,9:36
and we think about what's your 300,9:38
household what's your 300. so instead of,9:40
saying hey welcome to sam sales welcome,9:42
to jb vera's what we talk about is sales,9:44
training all day long that's great we,9:46
have sales trainers we don't need that,9:48
so instead how about we say hey,9:49
i suspect that you guys invest in sales,9:52
navigator you probably don't get the,9:53
adoption and the usage out of it one,9:55
specific thing that we can sell for you,9:56
is xyz,9:58
then again we've thought about that,9:59
person the specific buyer persona the,10:00
challenge that they have and we are,10:02
thinking about the key the key the key,10:04
the money maker for you here is the idea,10:05
of the hidden or forthcoming objection,10:07
if i say that to a vp of sales and say i,10:10
you guys have navigator we can help you,10:12
what they're going to say is we don't,10:14
need you we have a csm from linkedin to,10:15
which i can respond you might already,10:17
have a csm from linkedin but here's how,10:20
we can train you better and here's also,10:22
why we train linkedin on how to use,10:24
linkedin mic drop so we've got to think,10:26
about the hidden or forthcoming,10:29
objection in order to get around it in,10:30
the email because i promise you they're,10:32
not going to a respond and they're not,10:33
going to respond with that objection,10:34
get around it if you already know what,10:36
it is if you know what the typical thing,10:38
is that comes back do that final thing i,10:40
never ever ever ever i love calendly,10:42
they're great i never ever ever put a,10:44
calendar link to my calendar in outbound,10:46
email how presumptuous i say this all,10:49
the time tom has definitely heard me say,10:51
this but to me it is the equivalent of,10:52
walking up to somebody at a bar being,10:54
like you're adorable i'd love to get,10:56
drinks sometime that person says that's,10:57
great and you say here's my calendar for,10:59
you to schedule that date with me no,11:01
we would never do that and yet somehow,11:04
we think it's appropriate outbound sales,11:05
be human be different say let me know,11:08
what works for you i'd love to schedule,11:10
time with you and let me know your times,11:11
and i'll send a calendar invite along,11:13
recording like do the work give a shit,11:14
