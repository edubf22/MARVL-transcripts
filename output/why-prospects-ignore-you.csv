sentence,startTime
it's like the friend zone but way worse,0:00
that's all there is to it so the really,0:03
the for me like the way that i look at,0:06
the identity around someone ghosting is,0:09
that typically what's happening is just,0:11
something that's out of our control in,0:13
most cases whether it's personal,0:15
or there is a business initiative that,0:17
was going on behind the scenes that we,0:19
didn't know about right so,0:20
to me like putting a label on it to,0:22
understand more that there's uh there's,0:24
usually emotional context involved and,0:25
there are things that we can't,0:28
necessarily understand or explain,0:29
and also it,0:31
the thought about around that is to,0:33
curate your approach differently so more,0:36
empathy less hey did you get my last 17,0:38
emails you know like,0:41
that could just feel obnoxious to people,0:42
especially when it's not necessarily,0:44
their prerogative to ignore you to begin,0:46
with listen like anybody out there,0:49
that's listening i've been in sales for,0:51
15 plus years now,0:53
and i'm still a young guy okay i don't,0:55
have a lot of gray in my beard yeah,0:57
james buckley's gonna say something in,0:58
the comments here in a second about how,1:00
old i am because we've been hanging out,1:01
recently and he's like man your knees,1:03
are pretty bad bro can you even play,1:04
basketball anymore you suck old man,1:06
right so i digress the the idea though,1:09
is that i started at a young age as a,1:11
millennial and in a space where now like,1:13
pretty much every single decision maker,1:17
was like 30 years older than me when i,1:18
first got in that's how it looked and,1:20
and to myself i kept saying i must not,1:22
be relevant i must not be able to get,1:25
their attention correctly i had all,1:26
these things going on through my head,1:28
and really like an awakening for me and,1:29
understanding like what that ghosting,1:31
zone truly is is when i had somebody,1:33
finally get back to me and be like yo,1:35
just chill bro i'm gonna get back to you,1:36
like just chill and and i do it too to,1:39
people all the time and don't even mean,1:43
to in most cases so i think the one,1:44
thing that we want to understand about,1:46
the ghosting zone is that we're all,1:47
capable of becoming a victim to it and,1:49
that really it's about constant and,1:52
ongoing communication that goes beyond,1:54
your sale,1:56
and creates and provides emotional,1:57
context between the two of you as well,1:58
so that that person feels okay enough to,2:00
say something like hey my daughter just,2:02
had her baby and i'm gonna be,2:04
completely,2:07
away from my email for the next two days,2:08
sorry that i was supposed to sign your,2:10
deal tomorrow it's not going to happen,2:12
right that that proactive mindset is how,2:14
the ghosting zone for me really becomes,2:16
something that we live in constantly to,2:18
to,2:20
in a state of consistency i should say,2:21
to keep ourselves from having to suffer,2:23
inside of it,2:25
so you just have to think a little bit,2:27
bigger than what the typical playbook,2:29
would tell you right and please for the,2:32
love of god stop sending bump emails and,2:34
you know like just checking in and like,2:36
are you okay to the top of your inbox,2:38
check this out real quick yeah miranda,2:40
that's it right there check this out,2:42
real quick i just sent this email this,2:43
one works really well uh i just sent it,2:45
recently to three people i got three,2:47
responses the subject line is did you,2:49
die with a question mark now first off,2:52
be very careful about sending,2:54
that email you have to have a really,2:56
good relationship with people but think,2:58
about that for a second that i can send,3:00
that email to specific people and i know,3:02
they won't be offended i know they'll,3:04
laugh and i know they'll get back to me,3:06
right that is a deep connection right,3:08
there that's not just a hey let me send,3:10
this email and see if it works to this,3:13
random person that i'm trying to get,3:14
back in touch with right that is the,3:16
concept of proactively selling,3:18
connecting and giving people the right,3:20
kind of experience,3:21
now miranda have you ever used a,3:23
creative kind of outlet in your outreach,3:26
to really hook someone in and if so what,3:27
did you do,3:30
that's a great question i definitely,3:31
don't think i can compare to dale on any,3:33
of these but what i will say,3:34
is um something that i did that i think,3:36
has served me really well in my approach,3:39
is just humanizing myself in the process,3:41
and just being a person so the best,3:43
example i can give you is back in,3:45
december i was on a bit of a hot streak,3:47
in terms of i was still in sdr at that,3:50
point in time and i was going for our,3:51
record of the most meeting set in a day,3:53
and i was at nine and i really really,3:56
wanted to hit that ten and put myself,3:57
above just just for my own sake to,3:59
really feel proud of my performance for,4:01
the day and i was finally able to get,4:02
somebody back who had ghosted a,4:04
different um sdr of ours in the past and,4:06
really was like hey man i will i will,4:08
buy you and your significant other and,4:11
he was prepping for his anniversary,4:12
dinner with his wife and i was like let,4:14
me treat you and your wife to lunch,4:15
drinks whatever it is on me if you will,4:17
help me beat this record like this would,4:19
absolutely make or break my like sdr,4:21
career so far and ended up getting him,4:23
back and it ended up going pretty well,4:25
in my book so um definitely always pull,4:27
the anniversary card and um when in,4:29
doubt just,4:32
compliment their wife or their spouse,4:33
their partner and i found that worked,4:34
well too,4:35
i just want to reiterate like an,4:36
underscore,4:38
that these are people who you have had,4:40
some sort of connection with we're not,4:42
talking cold calling has never responded,4:43
to you so everything that dale and,4:45
miranda has said it's something that,4:47
they've actually had this relationship,4:48
they've created they've had conversation,4:50
so like just want to underscore it again,4:52
i think it's worth highlighting,4:54
my um,4:56
a couple things so the doordash story,4:58
adrian,4:59
i had someone who we had meetings booked,5:00
and then it was canceled meeting book,5:03
and then it was canceled and i was like,5:05
hey i just want to make sure,5:07
everything's okay and the woman replied,5:08
that she had a sick child at home and i,5:12
said,5:14
you know,5:15
we'll reschedule later don't even worry,5:16
about it i know what it's like from one,5:18
mother to another here's doordash so,5:21
that you can eat a real lunch today,5:22
and it was without the expectation of a,5:25
sale or booking and i think that that's,5:28
something that,5:30
is important too that we're being humans,5:32
right that we're showing up and it's,5:34
just hey i want to help you out i,5:35
understand what you're going through,5:37
been there right let me be a human and,5:39
just show that i care um and i know that,5:41
some people have boundaries in term or,5:44
like limits in terms of monetary gifts,5:46
if that's something that you can't do,5:48
the other thing that i think is,5:50
different that's showing up different is,5:53
send a video,5:55
when we are sending emails,5:57
a lot of times it's getting lost right,5:59
it's words it's text on a screen and,6:01
like some of the things show up and you,6:03
know i know miranda has done some,6:05
awesome memes memes the the giffies,6:07
right and like,6:11
but if we're showing up different if,6:12
they have a connection with us,6:14
and we can show that our concern is,6:16
genuine and that we care they can hear,6:18
the inflection in our voice we can joke,6:20
a little bit different because sometimes,6:23
people read things incorrectly but if,6:25
we're saying it,6:28
our tone is there and we have this,6:30
connection um i could just be like hey,6:32
hey we haven't been able to catch each,6:36
other thought i'd make you a quick video,6:38
um curious if anything's changed it's,6:40
completely fine if it has just let me,6:43
know,6:45
and,6:46
letting my tone and my energy show,6:47
through um,6:49
i've seen quite a few people,6:50
mention different industries than,6:52
they're in and what's working and what's,6:54
not and there is,6:55
a good piece of that like if you could,6:57
just show up,6:59
in a different way than what you have,7:00
been doing,7:02
you know any of these ideas showing up,7:04
different do something out of the box,7:06
pop em a linkedin voice note or oh yeah,7:09
hardcore with the linkedin voice note or,7:12
even a video on linkedin if you're first,7:15
degree connected like just something,7:17
different,7:18
something different can i riff on this,7:19
for a second is that of course like,7:21
feeling inspired as hell by leslie and,7:22
so there's a couple things that are very,7:25
important i think to what she's saying,7:27
that everybody can take a piece of which,7:28
is that she's talking about the basics,7:30
around like human principles and the,7:32
psychology of the way that a,7:35
regular human being operates so like,7:36
think back to being like 12 years old,7:39
and having a surprise birthday party,7:41
thrown for you and up to 12 years old,7:43
you've never had a surprise birthday,7:44
thrown for you so every year you're,7:46
expecting this kind of same thing for,7:48
your birthday and then your mom and dad,7:50
go all out and they hook it up and,7:51
you're at chuck e cheese and all your,7:53
friends are there and you're eating,7:54
pizza that a rat gave you and it's,7:56
incredible and and that that moment that,7:58
changes your life though right it,8:00
literally changes your freaking life and,8:02
this is the thing is that we we take for,8:04
granted the opportunities that we have,8:06
to impact people so often we think oh i,8:08
gotta hit quota oh i need to sell,8:11
something oh i want to buy that fancy,8:13
car and so i got to make this 17 000,8:15
commission shout out to all the copier,8:17
warriors out there that hit those big,8:18
bucks right so but the thought again is,8:20
is that how can i detach myself from,8:22
this leslie said something very,8:24
important that everybody needs to think,8:25
about expectations,8:26
what expectations do you have when,8:28
interacting with another human being are,8:30
you sitting back and saying oh i need,8:31
something from this person i have to,8:33
have this thing this deal could change,8:35
my life well guess what,8:37
that doesn't matter what matters is is,8:38
the fact that that you have the,8:40
opportunity to influence the way that,8:42
other people think about sales the way,8:44
that other people think about human,8:46
interaction at my father's funeral a guy,8:47
came up to me and there was thousands of,8:49
people that came up to me i mean,8:51
literally i'm not exaggerating nice for,8:52
eight hours after my dad's funeral we,8:54
had people coming up to us telling us,8:55
stories people we'd never met in our,8:57
lives there was a guy though,8:58
individually that that really relates to,8:59
this they came up to us and told us a,9:01
story about my dad doing something for,9:03
him that that he didn't even know my dad,9:05
did it right he had to like dig deep and,9:07
figure out that my dad had done this,9:10
thing to begin with and bless this,9:11
person and created a moment of impact,9:13
for them and it changed his literal life,9:16
he went he told me he said i went home,9:18
and i told my wife that i'd been having,9:21
an affair,9:23
and he said and she stayed with me god,9:24
bless her she stayed with me and he said,9:25
we've been together for like another 20,9:27
plus years and we have four kids and,9:28
we're extremely happy but if i if your,9:31
dad hadn't motivated me to get out of,9:32
this disgusting lifestyle that was in,9:34
and this these things that were nagging,9:37
at me deep in my soul by doing one,9:39
simple thing for me,9:41
one simple thing my life would never be,9:42
to be the same i probably wouldn't even,9:44
be standing here today that is extremely,9:46
powerful my dad sold copy machines,9:48
ladies and gentlemen right you have a,9:50
medium at your fingertips in all,9:52
instances of these types of things this,9:54
is more than ghosting right people,9:57
ghosts because of the the simple,9:58
examples that we've given but they they,10:00
technically ghost because they're living,10:02
their life,10:04
and we forget that so often and so i,10:05
love leslie's example and i think it's,10:08
just really important that we think so,10:09
much deeper than all this and that we,10:11
rebel against the status quo and the,10:13
mediocre and the typical that,10:14
everybody tells us we have to be doing,10:16
send a value proposition uh throw a,10:18
couple white papers over there and let,10:21
them read those like no give people an,10:23
experience show your heart sink your,10:25
teeth into those moments and not in a,10:27
weird way right but in a very romantic,10:29
way in the from the perspective of that,10:31
i am giving everything i have to this,10:33
thing right here and i promise you that,10:35
what you get as a result will be beyond,10:38
any expectation that you ever came in,10:40
with something that all this talk about,10:41
being a person and being proactive and,10:43
sort of and just sort of shooting them,10:45
straight that really rings true for me,10:46
is what we talk about ambition with,10:48
calling a spade a spade and really,10:50
breaking the fourth wall um and just not,10:52
putting up a front we're people there's,10:54
a reason that people do this job and,10:56
machines don't it's person to person and,10:58
the relationships is entirely what makes,11:00
or breaks a sale or makes or breaks a,11:02
relationship between you and yourself,11:04
and a prospect so what i've found that,11:05
like using this in my my calls as an sdr,11:08
and my deals as an ae is labeling and,11:12
really just sort of calling something,11:14
what it is and shooting them straight,11:15
and putting the ball in their court,11:17
which is like,11:18
it sounds like the timing's less than,11:19
ideal are we still interested in,11:20
continuing the conversation or should i,11:22
plan on reaching back out time a lot,11:24
down the line if not happy to part ways,11:25
as friends or in my case i guess now,11:28
it'll be happy to send a magician your,11:29
way with a business card for your,11:31
reference uh but really taking the,11:32
pressure off you can use your,11:34
personality i know a lot of our sdrs at,11:36
ambition use this with the memes and the,11:38
gifts and that really sets us apart but,11:40
is there anything that you can think of,11:42
as to why we uh why we why this time,11:43
frame wouldn't work for you or why we,11:45
can't move forward and again really,11:47
really putting the the ball back in,11:49
their court there,11:50
