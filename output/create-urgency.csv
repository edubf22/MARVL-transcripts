this tip is about creating urgency,0:00
and i'm gonna tell you right now you,0:03
can't stop asking i get that question,0:05
all the time sales rep hey john how do,0:08
you create urgency we can't create,0:09
urgency as sales reps look we can,0:12
manufacture urgency all day long by,0:14
discounting and that type of thing but,0:16
that's sad,0:18
but creating it no no no what we can do,0:19
though is we can uncover it and we can,0:22
drive it,0:24
and the way that we do that is by,0:25
focusing on the priorities of the,0:26
organization of the individual we're,0:29
talking to,0:30
because look i've always been a priority,0:32
based seller okay i've always,0:34
fundamentally understood that when your,0:35
ceo stood up in the beginning of the,0:37
year and said these are the things that,0:38
we got to do to be successful this year,0:40
if i can't time my solution to one or,0:42
two of those things good luck selling,0:44
anything of significance but,0:46
unfortunately the way i used to get,0:47
there was by saying stuff like tell me,0:48
about your priorities,0:50
so now i go in,0:51
and i really try to understand the,0:53
persona in the industry and the company,0:55
that i'm looking at i do my research so,0:56
i can uncover what they're trying to get,0:58
accomplished because they don't care,1:00
about everything that we do they care,1:02
about the components of what we do that,1:04
are going to help them achieve their,1:05
goals or solve their big problems and so,1:07
we got to find out what that is and once,1:10
we find out what those priorities are,1:12
what those problems are and the impact,1:14
that those problems have,1:17
then,1:19
we have urgency we have impact and then,1:20
we can push right then we can keep,1:24
reminding them are these still your,1:26
priorities is this still your timeline,1:27
is this still the impact yes well then,1:29
we need to keep moving here and if they,1:31
ghost you you can have a document and,1:33
say are these still your priorities is,1:35
this still your timeline because if it's,1:36
not no worries just let's get back on a,1:38
call so we can reset expectations here,1:40
because that's what i was based on,1:42
everything,1:43
but if it it but if it is let's let's,1:44
move here,1:46
so you can drive urgency you can uncover,1:47
urgency but you can't create it,1:50
the way that you drive it and uncover it,1:52
is by understanding the priorities of,1:54
the business and how your solution,1:56
aligns with us and the impact that you,1:57
have to help them get there all right,1:59
don't try to create it,2:01
uncover it and drive it make it happen,2:03
