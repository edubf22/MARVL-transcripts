sentence,startTime
oh sure can dissect it um i think,0:00
there's all these,0:03
i want to say like cliche comments when,0:05
we talk about,0:07
um,0:09
goal setting and i'm sure like give me a,0:10
one in the chat have you heard like,0:13
boiling the ocean or how do you eat an,0:14
elephant one bite at a time right like,0:17
anyone um,0:19
when we are thinking about,0:21
our numbers for our team for ourselves,0:24
a lot of this comes down to,0:27
it can become overwhelming when the,0:31
pressure is on and we're looking at this,0:33
huge hill that we have to climb whether,0:36
it's revenue or daily activity or,0:39
just deliverables in general,0:44
how can we make it smaller micro micro,0:47
goals it's much more attainable um,0:50
anyone a fan of the book atomic habits,0:53
james clear does a phenomenal job about,0:56
explaining this if we can just take it,0:59
like one day at a time,1:02
it's hard to see,1:04
that we can achieve something when it's,1:06
too big and we can't understand it like,1:08
space is ginormous but can i think about,1:11
you know,1:14
north america,1:15
can i think about north carolina can i,1:17
think about my cul-de-sac or whatever it,1:19
is if i can bring it down,1:22
to just what's right here right now,1:24
much more attainable,1:26
mindset wise and puts us all in a much,1:29
better,1:32
spot to go achieve that goal i mean a,1:33
real quick guidance on like the easiest,1:36
way to coach for the the leaders and,1:38
managers out there don't overthink this,1:40
you start with what went well and then,1:42
you go to what didn't go well and the,1:44
thing that didn't go well you talk about,1:46
how it's going to go well next time like,1:47
that basic basic framework works for,1:50
almost any coaching conversation now,1:53
what gets lost a lot in the coaching,1:56
conversation in addition to being,1:57
positive like you said it all runs,2:00
downhill like you as a leader need to be,2:02
that umbrella that's blocking that to,2:04
your team right and and when you block,2:06
it you also create a framework around,2:09
how you're going to help that rep in,2:11
those one-on-one conversations,2:14
and so,2:16
the one of the big misses is that,2:17
conversation is only around pipeline,2:19
there's more to the role than pipeline,2:22
it's a huge part important part but,2:23
there can be more to it the second part,2:25
is nothing is documented in that,2:27
conversation and so there's no real,2:29
action item that comes off of it where,2:31
there's accountability and and,2:33
oftentimes for me that is on me hey if,2:35
leslie's on my team hey leslie i'm going,2:38
to email james,2:40
uh because we're stuck in this account,2:42
and i'm going to help you as your leader,2:44
and then the last part it needs to be,2:46
metric driven like make the,2:48
kpis all in one place where everybody,2:50
knows how you're performing it's not a,2:52
mystery so create a structure,2:55
uh or be well first be that umbrella,2:58
create that structure share the positive,3:00
with the constructive and make sure it's,3:03
documented and there's action items and,3:05
metrics that come off of it why does all,3:07
that stuff matter people want to know,3:09
where they stand uncertainty,3:11
breeds chaos right and so if somebody,3:14
doesn't know where they stand,3:17
then uh they're insecure in their role,3:19
and they're not going to perform well so,3:22
good or bad that needs to be transparent,3:23
and,3:26
as you can tell this is a pretty core,3:27
thing to us at ambition,3:29
so the question is how do we coach to,3:31
the individual's motivate motivation,3:32
because a 22 year old live at home,3:34
seller isn't the same as a 42 year old,3:36
father of three sellers right they're,3:38
motivated differently thank you uh,3:40
there's a quick answer to this you ask,3:42
them,3:44
people way overweight yeah way overthink,3:45
the the motivation or they always assume,3:48
it's money like for me it really isn't,3:51
financial i want to win now i want to be,3:54
compensated fairly and i know what that,3:57
should be and all of those things,3:59
but,4:01
i'm terrified to lose like the,4:02
motivation is i don't want to lose and,4:04
and i will spend that as in like i want,4:07
to win and when a deal signs for someone,4:10
on my team i feel immense joy right and,4:12
so you have to you have to i know for me,4:16
before i had kids my motivation was a,4:19
lot different than now that i have three,4:20
little ones like it's a very different,4:22
uh piece there so ask them that's the,4:25
answer ask them,4:27
leslie thoughts on coaching to,4:29
individuals and then the difference,4:31
between coaching to individuals and the,4:33
team as a whole,4:34
yeah um,4:36
mark hit it right on the head like for,4:37
him it's winning,4:39
i,4:40
that was one of the questions in my get,4:41
to know you anyone new who's joining the,4:43
team is like,4:45
okay talk to me about your goals,4:47
what are they what do they look like and,4:49
then i'd ask questions just tell me more,4:51
about that the same way that we like,4:53
would ask prospects questions,4:56
i think some of the most common things,4:58
that i see come up is like when um,5:00
we do a contest in a sales team it's,5:03
like the winner gets,5:06
you know a 50 gift card,5:08
here's starbucks or visa or whatever it,5:11
is um but mark like he just wants to win,5:13
so maybe he doesn't maybe the money's,5:16
not motivating him it's the,5:18
you know badge of honor it's,5:21
uh recognition so like sending an email,5:24
to,5:27
your c-suite and copying him in about,5:28
how great mark is or maybe it's,5:31
extra time off on you you get to leave,5:34
early on friday and go hang out with,5:36
your family or go to the beach or do,5:38
whatever it is that you want to do,5:40
everyone has a different feel,5:42
so like i've seen some really great,5:45
spiffs where it's like choose your own,5:47
adventure,5:48
here's the options so that you're not,5:50
sticking reps into,5:53
just,5:55
one thing that you think is going to,5:56
cover everyone because we're all sales,5:59
people,6:00
can i add here too that so ambition runs,6:02
a ton of contests like tens of thousands,6:05
of contests every year about 80 of those,6:07
don't have a prize it's visibility it's,6:10
how does james ceo see that mark the sdr,6:13
just set a meeting in an easy way put an,6:16
emoji right so don't think you always,6:18
have to have a prize,6:20
but to leslie's point individualizing,6:22
what the prize could be,6:24
we've had a number let's call it 200,6:26
bucks is what you win for the prize well,6:28
before that contest starts i'm going to,6:31
say hey go on amazon prime find me,6:32
something or multiple things that amount,6:34
to 200 bucks,6:36
and send it to me and if you win that's,6:37
what you're getting right so that is,6:40
such an easy way to individualize what,6:42
they get if it is a prize and anyone can,6:44
do that so um the first thing i want,6:46
people to hear is you don't always have,6:49
to have a prize visibility is huge and,6:50
then the second is there's easy ways to,6:53
individualize that through amazon,6:55
i think first off it's like talking,6:58
about it sharing our own and like making,6:59
sure everyone feels like,7:02
there's a piece of that i think imposter,7:04
syndrome is kind of thrown around and,7:06
there's some crazy articles out there,7:07
you can see,7:10
someone said something to me a couple,7:11
years back i wrote it down on a sticky,7:13
note i still have it in my calendar to,7:15
this day and it says there's no,7:17
b to b,7:21
or b to c anymore business is not,7:22
business to business or business to,7:24
consumer it's h human to human,7:26
and,7:30
especially when you're,7:31
starting out somewhere new when you're,7:33
fresh out of college,7:37
it is very intimidating because we're,7:39
always taught to respect you know it's,7:41
like you you hold the teacher in a high,7:44
regard you hold parents in a high regard,7:46
you and it's like this different dynamic,7:48
of power,7:50
and it's really hard to undo that,7:51
learning and just have a human,7:53
conversation with someone because you,7:55
feel like oh my gosh he's got a c in his,7:57
title,8:00
that means i have to treat him,8:02
differently or that i'm not as good as,8:04
that person and if we can start talking,8:06
about like,8:08
having those fostering those,8:10
conversations internally,8:11
letting,8:13
letting is a bad but like having our sdr,8:15
our bdr team our new hires anyone be,8:18
able to sit down and have coffee with,8:21
your ceo or just have a normal,8:23
conversation and see that they're a real,8:25
human,8:26
goes,8:28
beyond,8:29
vps whatever if you're a senior leader,8:30
especially like just go hang out and,8:32
have a talk not necessarily all about,8:34
work,8:36
with your,8:38
team,8:39
your,8:40
false evidence appearing real that,8:41
that's what uh perez just put in there,8:42
shout out to peres for that one uh,8:44
that's what fear i've heard that acronym,8:46
a couple of times now fear false,8:48
evidence appearing real,8:50
so that's good um mark the imposter,8:51
syndrome thing uh you guys probably see,8:54
this often,8:56
one everybody has it,8:57
like i have it we all have moments where,8:59
we have imposter syndrome so if you're,9:03
like an sdr calling on a c-suite person,9:04
you probably think,9:08
man do i like deserve to have this,9:09
conversation yes right and and why,9:12
because that c-suite person yeah that,9:16
they know a lot about a lot but if you,9:18
know your thing really well,9:21
then you know more than they do about,9:24
your thing right and so,9:26
um that impostor syndrome one just admit,9:29
that it's a thing and it's okay and most,9:32
people i know have it,9:35
but two if you become an expert in your,9:37
little niche,9:40
regardless of who you're talking to you,9:42
are the expert and so you can help,9:44
inform educate solve problems for that,9:46
person,9:49
and,9:50
you don't have to know every in and out,9:51
of their business you just got to know,9:53
your little corner,9:54
