this tip is about how to run a call,0:00
blitz,0:02
now,0:03
i personally think that sprinkling phone,0:04
calls throughout the day drastic waste,0:05
of time can't learn anything there you,0:07
can't get any momentum,0:09
and,0:11
these days it's a fool's errands,0:12
where i know phone works,0:14
is,0:16
when you're focused and i call them,0:17
power hours okay so for an hour i'm just,0:19
gonna make calls i'm not gonna do a,0:22
phone call do some research write an,0:24
email make another phone call again i,0:25
can't gain any momentum that way so for,0:27
an hour i'm just going to make cold,0:29
calls and i'm going to be hyper,0:31
efficient effective with that now,0:33
a key to that power hour,0:35
most sales reps when they do a call,0:37
blitz they just bring their list of,0:39
clients okay and it's anybody and,0:40
everybody right so it's cios cfos vps of,0:43
this and all sorts of different,0:46
industries and look,0:47
when you,0:49
have a whole bunch of different,0:50
industries a whole bunch of different,0:51
personas you're forced to be generic in,0:52
that call blitz you're forced to say,0:54
stuff like tell me about your business,0:56
you're forced to say stuff like hey what,0:57
are your priorities and give a generic,1:00
elevator pitch,1:02
because i don't know about you i am not,1:03
good enough on the fly to help have a,1:04
relevant good conversation with a vp of,1:07
sales in the sas industry a director of,1:09
i.t in the manufacturing industry and a,1:11
cfo in the healthcare industry i'm just,1:12
not that bright,1:14
so instead of taking anybody and,1:15
everybody you want to focus on a,1:17
singular persona,1:19
ideally in an industry so vp's the sales,1:21
and sas cfos in manufacturing whatever,1:24
that is because what you can do with,1:26
that is you can do a little bit of,1:28
homework to figure out you know cfos,1:29
manufacturing priorities challenges 2020,1:31
whatever right read a few articles come,1:33
up with a message right that is relevant,1:35
at least to cfos and manufacturing,1:38
then come up with two or three questions,1:41
that are relevant to them that you might,1:42
be able to ask to get the conversation,1:44
going and then maybe even have a case,1:45
study or a story to tell that's relevant,1:47
to them based on the personas that,1:49
you're calling into in that industry now,1:51
i usually do about a half hour prep or,1:54
45 minute prep for a one-hour coblets,1:56
where i get my names i get my messaging,1:58
down i'm all ready to go and then for,1:59
that hour all i'm doing is making calls,2:01
i'm not like i said doing research but,2:04
i'm just hey the reason for my call,2:06
today is we show cfos in manufacturing,2:08
how to rinse repeat rinse repeat rinse,2:10
repeat and look the first few phone,2:12
calls are gonna be a little rough they,2:13
always are but that third fourth fifth,2:15
call if you're calling into the same,2:17
persona with the same message you're,2:18
gonna get better and better and better,2:20
and every time you get someone on the,2:22
phone you're going to be able to parlay,2:23
that to the next call and get better and,2:25
better and have a lot more momentum,2:26
and you can learn something,2:28
because now with that approach you can,2:31
usually get about 20 25 dials done in an,2:32
hour and that's even with some decent,2:35
conversations then afterwards that's,2:37
when you send all your information,2:39
because you can be very efficient with,2:40
that so now you do that for an hour in,2:41
the morning,2:43
and then the afternoon you do the same,2:44
thing and you go after the same persona,2:46
but with a different message so you can,2:48
test to see which one works better,2:49
now if you do that right a lot of people,2:52
talk about 50 dials a day for instance,2:54
and how hard that is to hit and i agree,2:56
with you if you sprinkle 50 dials,2:58
throughout the day it is really hard to,3:00
hit that number,3:01
but if i do a power hour and i do 25,3:03
dials in this hour and 25 an hour an,3:06
hour i can be pretty damn efficient with,3:08
that if i do the prep work so now with,3:09
about half hour prep half hour follow up,3:11
on both of those two hours two hours,3:14
that's four hours of the day the rest of,3:16
the day i can do whatever i want with,3:18
and i've hit my numbers and i've learned,3:19
something and i've been efficient and i,3:21
got momentum so that's how to run a call,3:24
blitz make it happen,3:26
