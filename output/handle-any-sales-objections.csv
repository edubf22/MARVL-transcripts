sentence,startTime
so uh we've got some suggestions for you,0:00
uh we are uh excited to bring these to,0:02
you this is how we would handle these,0:05
objections i'm not even gonna i'm not,0:06
even gonna fluff this up let's go let's,0:07
go all right here we go is this a sales,0:09
call john,0:11
ah so this one's a good one because,0:12
again the nuances of this one matter if,0:14
you ask is this a sales call versus is,0:16
this a cold call so this is why it's,0:18
important to write down all your,0:20
objections word for word now if this is,0:21
a sales call here's my john barrow's,0:24
masshole approach to this one is not,0:26
like i don't know how the exact words i,0:29
say are,0:32
uh it depends,0:34
and they'll i usually say excuse me and,0:35
i'll say well it depends what currently,0:38
you guys fit a very similar profile to,0:40
some other clients that we've do some,0:42
done some great work with and all i'm,0:43
looking for right now is about five to,0:45
ten minutes of somebody's time so i can,0:47
have that conversation and if there's a,0:48
need then yes it turns into a sales call,0:50
but as of right now i don't know,0:52
so it's kind of a little bit of a,0:55
jackass like way of doing it but,0:56
it it it keeps the conversation going,0:59
because they're almost always like when,1:01
you say i don't know it depends they're,1:02
they're always gonna say what what do,1:05
you mean by that and it's almost gonna,1:07
be contentious but then if you show them,1:09
you've done your research on the account,1:11
before you've made that phone call and,1:12
there's an actual reason for your call,1:14
sometimes they're more open to having,1:16
that discovered,1:18
i like that you know i kind of say that,1:20
depends too but instead of,1:21
the mass way that you describe what,1:24
i love that term which what i say is do,1:27
you hang up on sales people,1:29
and then i just leave it there,1:31
now if you're calling especially if,1:33
you're like calling people that lead,1:34
sales teams which is often the case,1:36
right we're calling leaders yeah if you,1:37
say do you hang up on sales people and,1:39
they manage sales people i think there's,1:41
like this little tinge of guilt that,1:42
they care,1:44
and a little laugh there kind of helps,1:45
well and i think well that's an,1:48
important point like if you can it's all,1:49
a lot of it is about pattern interrupt,1:51
and doing something that's a little,1:53
different and also being a normal human,1:54
being too i mean you don't have to be a,1:56
jerk like when i say it depends i'm,1:57
being genuine it does it's not that i'm,1:59
saying oh i'm trying to use a trick here,2:02
it really does depend i'm not trying to,2:04
sell you anything,2:06
that you don't need but if there's a,2:08
need yeah then i'm going to sell you,2:10
something because it's going to make a,2:12
difference here and if you have that,2:12
mentality i think you can get away with,2:14
that approach,2:15
i like it i like it john why don't you,2:16
call me back in six months,2:18
so great perfect so just out of,2:21
curiosity what's going to change in six,2:23
months right and and you could do that,2:24
or what i also like to do is ask this,2:27
hey what are the other initiatives that,2:30
you're working on right now that are,2:31
taking priority over something like this,2:33
and how is that going to change and when,2:35
when do you think those are going to get,2:36
off your plate so we can have a real,2:37
conversation about this because what i'm,2:39
trying to do there is get some context,2:41
from you so that when i do call you back,2:44
i have something to reference so if,2:47
you're like look right now i'm just too,2:49
buried i'm working on xyz projects,2:50
because they got weight they're taking,2:52
up way too much of my time well,2:53
fantastic great you know what i'll call,2:54
you back in six months and we can have a,2:56
much better conversation at that point,2:58
now when i call you back in six months,3:00
i'm gonna a do my research on you to,3:01
make sure that i have a reason to reach,3:03
out to you and b i'm gonna reference,3:04
what you told me six months ago to let,3:06
you know that we've actually had a,3:08
meaningful conversation i'll probably,3:09
call you three months later by the way,3:11
i like that one uh leslie has a good one,3:13
that's quick and easy she says i'm just,3:15
curious why,3:17
yep and i think that's a great response,3:19
it's fast it's easy my fast easy,3:21
response is is that when you focus on,3:23
new initiatives,3:25
and sometimes you get people that are,3:27
really they give you the brush off right,3:28
they're like yeah totally new,3:30
initiatives whatever man yeah and you're,3:31
like all right cool like you were never,3:32
interested in this conversation to begin,3:33
with right but then sometimes they're,3:35
like well it's not that it's just that,3:37
and then they fill in the gap of what,3:39
they're focused on and i can attach my,3:41
value to the things that matter so you,3:43
sort of set them up for that that very,3:45
human response uh that's the job john is,3:46
this a good,3:49
real quick the key to all this is,3:50
getting them to continue to talk because,3:52
the more they talk the more they're,3:54
gonna they're gonna hit you with an,3:56
objection right up front that's a real,3:57
basic lame you know surface level,3:59
objection and if you can just get them,4:01
talking more nine times out of ten you,4:03
they get you can kind of at least,4:05
unravel a little bit what they're really,4:06
what their situation is and then real,4:08
have a real conversation sorry what's,4:10
the next one no no you're fine you're,4:12
fine uh and you're right like the whole,4:13
most of what we're saying here is about,4:15
keeping the conversation going if you,4:16
can manage to keep the conversation,4:18
going it'll last as long as it needs to,4:20
last you know if it's 10 minutes great,4:22
if it's half an hour and they end the,4:24
call with man this was a really,4:25
refreshing call you did a great job,4:26
now is not the right time john can you,4:29
this is not a good time for me,4:31
uh so totally get that most people i,4:34
talk to this is kind of the feel for fun,4:36
totally get that most people i talk to,4:38
don't have time immediately um when,4:39
would be a good time and and what is on,4:42
your plate right now that's getting in,4:44
your way of having this conversation so,4:45
again trying to understand what's going,4:46
on in their world right now and lock,4:48
them into a certain time and then if,4:50
they say tomorrow at three o'clock or,4:52
i'm sorry if they say next week what you,4:54
want to do is win next week and be very,4:56
specific actually you got your calendar,4:58
in front of you look why don't we just,5:00
throw something on the calendar now this,5:01
way we don't have to play chase and by,5:02
the way those words are important this,5:04
way we don't have to play chase letting,5:06
them know you're going to chase them and,5:08
we can do this the easy way or the hard,5:10
way it's your choice yeah we can do this,5:11
dance for like 10 weeks where like i,5:14
hate you all the time and you ignore me,5:16
and then i keep hitting you and then you,5:18
call me and going we can do that it's,5:19
totally fine or we could set it up and,5:21
really have like a good conversation,5:24
right,5:25
i say,5:26
we should throw something on your,5:28
calendar when they say this isn't a good,5:29
time we should throw something on your,5:31
calendar and you can even follow it with,5:32
what works next week,5:34
are you in front of your calendar is a,5:36
really magic question because anybody,5:37
that tells you no is a liar,5:39
and also there's a small nuance to this,5:43
as well that that objection specifically,5:45
this also comes with a preemptive strike,5:47
so when you are cold calling if you are,5:49
getting the this isn't a good time all,5:51
the time,5:53
then start your call with that hey james,5:54
i know i probably didn't catch you at a,5:57
great time do you got 30 seconds to tell,5:59
you what so i can tell you why i'm,6:00
calling before you hang up on me right,6:01
so you preemptively address you know,6:03
it's not a good time it's never a good,6:05
time when somebody calls that's why i,6:07
hate the intro is this a good time the,6:08
reason is is,6:11
the reason it's always no is because i,6:12
don't know who you are and therefore i,6:14
have no idea how long this is going to,6:16
take right so if you start your intro a,6:18
lot of these objections that you get can,6:20
be preempted by how you introduce,6:22
yourself on the phone like a lot of,6:24
times i'll just say hey james thanks for,6:26
taking my call can i get 30 seconds to,6:29
tell you why i'm calling before you hang,6:30
up on me and and that's a preemptive,6:32
strike and all i'm trying to do there is,6:34
sell 30 seconds because if i can sell,6:35
that 30 seconds and you get to agree to,6:38
those 30 seconds then in that 30 seconds,6:39
my value proposition should hopefully,6:41
buy me another two minutes maybe to ask,6:43
a question to keep this conversation and,6:45
in those two minutes that's gonna buy me,6:47
that discovery call yeah you're gonna,6:49
notice john's pattern there where he's,6:51
buying more time with each response and,6:52
there's that pattern of like make a,6:56
statement and then ask a question uh so,6:57
here's a good one i think people get,6:59
this one a lot especially at the,7:01
enterprise level you know what john this,7:02
sounds great but we do all this stuff,7:04
in-house,7:05
perfect there's most of the clients that,7:07
we work with as a matter of fact do a,7:08
lot of the stuff internally either you,7:10
know on a scale of one to ten of,7:12
everything that you're working on as it,7:14
relates to this are you a 10 out of 10,7:15
at every level,7:17
right and what i'm trying to do there is,7:19
get base if you say you're a 10 out of,7:21
10 at every level with what i'm bringing,7:22
to the table for you that's a hundred,7:24
percent of a blow-off and and by the way,7:25
i'm actually that's a that's not,7:27
necessarily a bad thing because i'm,7:29
going to use that later because i'm,7:30
going to call you back and i'm going to,7:31
say to you you're like yep i'm a 10 out,7:33
of 10 with everything all right james,7:34
look nope they're great man look most of,7:36
our clients aren't a 10 out of 10 with,7:38
everything i mean it might be 9.5 but,7:40
not 10 good for you hey would you mind,7:42
if i called you back in like three to,7:43
six months to see if you were still out,7:45
of 10 out of 10 with that right because,7:46
and you're usually gonna say yeah sure,7:49
fine and then i'm gonna call you in,7:50
three months i'm gonna say hey james we,7:52
talked about three months ago you said,7:53
you were a 10 out of 10 with how you,7:55
were dealing with everything internally,7:57
as it relates to this if it's even,7:58
dipped to a nine man there's a reason,8:00
for us to chat,8:01
i really like that because you're sort,8:03
of setting it up so that you can f like,8:05
it's like a touch that you want to know,8:07
if this person just wants you to go away,8:08
exactly and when they give me a 10 out,8:11
of 10 they just want you to go away,8:12
and but the beauty of that is you're,8:15
going to bring it back to them and,8:16
you're going to use it against them,8:18
later because because when i call you,8:19
three months you're not going to,8:21
remember that we had this conversation,8:22
three months ago but i'm going to say,8:23
that you said you were a 10. and so,8:25
nobody's ever attend so if i catch you,8:28
in that moment of man i wish i had more,8:30
resources,8:32
now it's like man maybe i'm not and i'm,8:34
going in the wrong direction by the way,8:36
i was a 10 and now i'm nine now on the,8:37
other hand if you say that and they're,8:39
like well you know we're probably like a,8:41
nine or an eight it's okay great well,8:42
just you know for a few more minutes,8:44
here what would make it a 10,8:45
well if we had the ability to do x y and,8:47
z well look that's exactly what we do is,8:49
that worth 15 minutes so i can show you,8:53
how we're working with other internal,8:55
teams here and augmenting them so they,8:56
can get that time back to focus on those,8:58
other things that are more important to,9:00
them,9:01
man your your responses are like so,9:02
fast and i feel like they they,9:05
hit the high note and then they're gone,9:08
uh you know it's really fast and then,9:10
there's this engagement part of it that,9:13
comes afterwards where they have to,9:14
respond to you with thought you can't,9:16
just be like yeah yeah and then like,9:18
brush it off that's like a key factor in,9:19
all these objection handles that we're,9:21
giving you is people have to put thought,9:23
behind the answers the one that i throw,9:25
out there in this moment is is there,9:27
anything that you feel has been,9:29
overlooked this is their moment to tell,9:30
me whether or not they're a 10 out of 10,9:32
right and if they're if they are which,9:34
you know a lot of times you get the,9:36
brush off what i do is i go well listen,9:37
this is what we do i have a lot of,9:39
resources i want to share those with you,9:41
over time i'm going to send you some,9:43
emails i'm going to be getting in touch,9:44
with you soon but i appreciate your time,9:46
today thanks for the quick call and i,9:47
let them go,9:49
but then i drop them into this great,9:50
cadence that delivers consistent value,9:53
that's relevant to them and i get a lot,9:55
of thank yous i get a lot of this is the,9:57
best thing that's hit my inbox that just,9:59
happened to me yesterday this is the,10:01
best thing that hit my inbox if you can,10:02
get someone saying that you have,10:04
really won the game,10:05
absolutely,10:07
or you will win it eventually eventually,10:08
yeah i play the long game john you know,10:10
i play the long game it's hard to ignore,10:12
me dude,10:15
that's the key the key is the long game,10:16
if you are trying to convince somebody,10:18
in the short term and stuff it down,10:19
their throat you get you're gonna have,10:21
to do a volume game you're gonna have to,10:23
make hundreds of dials and just burn,10:24
through your list but if you play the,10:26
long game you can be patient you can,10:27
find the right opportunities you don't,10:30
have to push and people will respect it,10:31
we got a few more minutes i think we,10:33
have a few more minutes i want to get as,10:34
many of these in as we can i really like,10:35
this one because i think people get this,10:37
one most often especially when they're,10:38
playing that volume game i don't take,10:40
random cold calls,10:42
don't take foreign interesting one well,10:46
this isn't random uh and so here's i'm,10:49
thinking about this one on the fly here,10:51
because uh,10:52
i haven't had that one in a while but,10:54
it's uh you know well this isn't random,10:55
and they're gonna say again well what,10:58
are you talking about this isn't random,10:59
no no no you like look i get it if you,11:01
you probably get a bunch of phone calls,11:03
from people who are just ripping through,11:05
lists and giving you generic elevator,11:06
pitches i'm telling you right now,11:07
there's a reason i'm calling you and,11:09
this is why it's so important to have a,11:11
reason for your call all right for,11:14
everybody out there listening right now,11:17
when you start your phone call you have,11:18
to finish this sentence the reason for,11:20
my call is and you've got to be able to,11:21
finish that sentence if not you should,11:23
not be making the phone call and ideally,11:25
it's something based on research you've,11:27
done so therefore it's not random so,11:28
here's an here's a scenario james,11:31
you say to me uh john i don't take,11:33
random phone calls james i'm going to,11:35
tell you right now this is not random,11:37
and i'm going to dead stop on that and,11:39
it's gonna force you to go well what do,11:41
you mean james look i know you probably,11:43
get a bunch of phone calls from sales,11:45
reps who are just giving you some,11:47
generic pitch and you're on a list and,11:48
half of it yeah 99 of it's irrelevant,11:50
the reason i'm calling you is because i,11:53
was actually on your website and i,11:54
noticed that you're hiring a whole bunch,11:55
of sdrs right now and and we work with,11:57
companies who are hiring sdrs because,11:59
our training plugs right in and helps,12:01
them get ramped right out of boot camp,12:02
and that's why i'm calling you this is,12:04
not random my friend do you have five,12:05
minutes for a conversation about how we,12:07
do this so i first of all i want to make,12:09
two comments when you started that i,12:11
felt like wow that was aggressive well,12:13
let me tell you this is not random but,12:15
then you ended with can i tell you why,12:17
this isn't random my friend,12:19
and there was this like shift in in the,12:20
mind right where it's you feel like oh,12:22
and you're taken aback but then you hear,12:25
the my friend,12:27
and then there's this change in your,12:29
demeanor and i love that i feel like,12:30
that's a superhuman one uh,12:32
when you think about it that's all we're,12:35
trying to do is get people to open up,12:36
y'all we're just trying to get them to,12:38
open up they have to drop the rapport my,12:39
my the one that i go to when people say,12:41
i don't take calls is well,12:43
do you guys have callers,12:45
and i leave it right there do you guys,12:48
have callers i i have the the luxury of,12:49
calling sales leaders most of the time,12:52
so for me,12:54
for me when i say do you have callers,12:55
the answer is almost always yes i say,12:57
well i'm sure you want people to take,12:59
their cold calls right,13:01
but it's fine if you don't like cold,13:02
calls we can set something up are you in,13:04
front of your calendar and i pivot there,13:06
most of the time people will decide to,13:08
pivot and at least give me some level of,13:10
respect which is all i'm asking for in,13:12
that moment right,13:14
you have callers respect me as a caller,13:15
that's all i'm asking,13:17
uh john this is one of my favorites and,13:18
i think this one goes a long way for a,13:20
lot of people john we're all set we're,13:21
good,13:23
okay so are you i'm gonna go back to my,13:25
10 out of 10. so are you a 10 out of 10,13:26
with your existing solution in place and,13:28
again i'm going to back down to if it's,13:30
a 9 what would make it a 10 and would,13:32
that be worth 10 minutes to show you how,13:34
if it's a 10 great can i call you back,13:36
in three months to see if it's still out,13:38
of 10 out of 10 and then i'm gonna call,13:40
you in three months and say you said,13:41
three months ago that you were a 10 out,13:43
of 10 with this if it's dipped to a nine,13:44
we should have a conversation,13:46
again quick fast there you notice,13:48
there's no like stuttering and there's,13:50
no stammering in his response and i,13:52
think that's because,13:54
when you start thinking about these,13:56
types of objections in advance and you,13:57
start working on them yourself it,13:59
becomes second nature to respond in the,14:01
general way that you would respond it,14:04
might not be the same exact language all,14:05
the time,14:07
my go-to for this one is when i hear,14:08
we're all set sometimes i think it means,14:11
people would rather not talk to me is,14:13
that what's happening here and i just,14:14
give them the chance to say yeah i can't,14:16
have this conversation right now and i,14:17
go that's cool i'll call you tomorrow,14:19
and then and then i hang up,14:20
look i we're coming up on time but i,14:23
wanted to make one point on your,14:25
previous point here which is,14:26
objection handling is about being,14:28
proactive versus reactive and you have,14:30
to use these techniques early on in your,14:31
career so that you know how to use them,14:33
later on in your career without thinking,14:35
about them as a technique the reason,14:37
that most of these can fly off of my,14:39
tongue is because i've made 400 dials a,14:40
week for the majority of my,14:42
career and i practiced these techniques,14:45
over and over and over again until they,14:47
became innate until they became natural,14:50
for me which is why i can kind of pop,14:52
and do it whenever,14:54
you gotta focus you gotta pick one,14:56
objection find figure out a technique,14:58
try it out a bunch of times and see how,15:00
it flows with you and you'll figure it,15:02
out along the way practice makes perfect,15:03
y'all i hope you enjoyed this we'll see,15:05
you soon come to the events that are,15:07
upcoming we promise that we will,15:09
continue to drive value that helps you,15:10
sell better we'll see you soon everybody,15:12
all right make it happen,15:14
