sentence,startTime
this might shock you when someone says,0:00
hey send me an email when you're cold,0:02
calling you get fired up you're like oh,0:04
this is going to be great i'm getting a,0:06
response and i got a sad thing to tell,0:07
you you're most likely not going to get,0:09
a response at all with this objection,0:11
this is morgan j ingram from cell better,0:14
and you have to subscribe to the channel,0:16
if you want to enhance your sales career,0:19
i think that's why you're here so you,0:20
might want to click that button now,0:22
let's go into how do you deal with this,0:23
objection when someone says send me an,0:26
email this one is my least favorite,0:28
every time i heard it when i was a sales,0:32
rep and even today i used to get really,0:34
fired up i was like oh yeah let me send,0:36
an email like they're going to respond,0:38
i'm getting a lot of meetings and then,0:39
all you hear is nothing crickets and,0:41
you're like,0:43
sucks i should go outside people can,0:44
take a walk i'm done with this right so,0:46
how do you do this with moving forward,0:49
we don't want you to cry we want you to,0:50
feel great and so how you go about this,0:52
objection is you have to ask a couple of,0:54
questions,0:57
and with all objections you have to ask,0:58
larry questions to truly uncover what is,1:00
going on so the first question you want,1:03
to ask is hey,1:05
out of curiosity what type of content,1:07
would you like to see,1:11
in this email most people don't ask this,1:12
question they just send an email that's,1:14
generic and then it gets deleted it,1:16
doesn't matter so typically the prospect,1:17
will respond and give you a couple bit,1:19
of information now i know some of you,1:21
out there like morgan what if they say,1:23
no like what do i do i got you so when,1:24
this happens you're gonna say hey look,1:27
when people don't give me the exact,1:30
information they're looking for in a,1:32
follow-up email it isn't looking like,1:34
spam to them it isn't getting deleted,1:36
and it wastes both of our times so,1:38
what exactly are you looking for in this,1:40
email that way they'll acknowledge you,1:43
they'll be like okay i don't want to get,1:45
spam i don't want to get blown up nobody,1:46
wants that right i don't think you do so,1:47
now what we can do is follow up with,1:49
information and this part is where we're,1:52
gonna do a give get so if you're new to,1:54
sales a give get is basically i'm gonna,1:56
give you something in this case,1:58
information to get something in return,2:00
which is i want a meeting so,2:02
what i'm gonna say here is i'm to send,2:04
you an email with all the information,2:07
that you just talked about however what,2:09
we found to be best with people i talk,2:11
to like yourself is to set up a,2:12
conversation with you next wednesday,2:14
three o'clock it looks like i'm open so,2:17
that we can talk about this information,2:19
does that sound fair and now people are,2:21
like wow this is incredible i'm gonna,2:23
get content right and then also as well,2:25
we can book the meeting for next,2:28
wednesday and now we're good to go so,2:31
that is the way that you handle send me,2:33
an email i don't want any of y'all to,2:36
not do it this way and be like morgan is,2:37
stuck no we want to be able to get and,2:40
overcome this objection and if you want,2:42
more ways to handle objections subscribe,2:44
