this tip is about the power of impact,0:00
questions,0:02
when it comes to Discovery the key to,0:03
Discovery is finding impact what kind of,0:06
impact is that problem that they're,0:10
facing having on their business what,0:12
kind of impact can your solution have on,0:14
their business because if we can't find,0:17
impact what's the point we're going to,0:19
lose the nose decision all day long,0:22
so we want to find out impact and by,0:24
doing this what we can do is really,0:26
leverage that information to push back,0:28
on the client when they go dark on us,0:31
out into the dark side but when they,0:33
change their priorities because they,0:35
told us there was significant impact if,0:36
this happened or not,0:38
so the easiest way to cheat with impact,0:40
questions is put the word impact into,0:43
the question and I'll give you a perfect,0:45
one here that I recommend all of you try,0:47
which look we all ask for the timeline,0:49
okay which is hey when do you want to,0:52
have this implemented by or launched by,0:53
or whatever and then we do the reverse,0:55
close so say that's March 1st or,0:57
whatever,0:59
um okay well then it usually takes about,1:00
two weeks to go through procurement but,1:01
it takes about two weeks to get on,1:03
boarded and we go from there so if you,1:04
want it by March 1st and we have to,1:06
assign this week okay we all do that,1:08
but I really encourage you to do is ask,1:10
this question hey just out of curiosity,1:13
what's the impact to your business if we,1:15
don't launch on March 1st,1:18
and see what they say because there's,1:20
really only two answers to that question,1:22
one is real impact right all we're gonna,1:24
miss this deadline we're gonna you know,1:26
and by the way it's not just we're gonna,1:28
be stuck with our existing vendor or uh,1:29
we're gonna miss out on the promo and,1:32
the discount that's not impact I mean,1:33
business impact here right and there's,1:35
real some they'll be able to articulate,1:37
that to you and if you have that well,1:39
guess what now you can push again when,1:41
they ghost you or you can bring that up,1:43
and say hey wait a minute you said this,1:44
was the impact of your business and,1:46
that's why I'm pushing so hard and you,1:47
can really be a challenger sale,1:49
but the other answer to that question is,1:51
well we'll just kind of keep doing what,1:53
we're doing,1:55
and if you get that answer you are,1:56
either not talking to the right person,1:58
or I would not forecast that opportunity,1:59
you gotta look for impact so stop asking,2:01
these fluffy questions ask questions,2:05
looking for impact to the business all,2:07
right make it happen,2:10
